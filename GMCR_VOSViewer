Marc			A matrix approach to status quo analysis in the graph model for conflict resolution	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Status quo analysis; Decision support system; Matrix representation; Graph model for conflict resolution; Multiple decision makers	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; PREFERENCE UNCERTAINTY; ENVIRONMENTAL CONFLICT; REPRESENTATION	An algebraic method is developed to carry out status quo analysis within the framework of the graph model for conflict resolution. As a form of post-stability analysis, status quo analysis aims at confirming that possible equilibria, or states stable for all decision-makers, are in fact reachable from the status quo or any other initial state. Although pseudo-codes for status quo analysis have been developed, they have never been implemented within a practical decision support system. The novel matrix approach to status quo analysis designed here is convenient for computer implementation and easy to employ, as is illustrated by an application to a real-world conflict case. Moveover, the proposed explicit matrix approach reveals an inherent link between status quo analysis and the traditional stability analysis and, hence, provides the possibility of establishing an integrated paradigm for stability and status quo analyses.

J	Nandalal, KDW; hipel, keith william				Nandalal, K. D. W.; hipel, keith william			Strategic decision support for resolving conflict over water sharing among countries along the Syr Darya River in the Aral Sea Basin	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Asia; decision support systems; water resources; international factors	RESOURCES; SYSTEM	The graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR), along with its associated decision support system GMCR II, are employed for systematically studying the strategic aspects of conflict existing among countries in the Aral Sea Basin of Central Asia. Competition for water is increasing in the central Asian countries in the Aral Sea Basin since they became independent in 1991. Disputes have developed between the three downstream countries, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, and the two upstream countries, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, in the basin in sharing water in its two main rivers, Syr Darya and Amu Darya. The downstream countries are heavy consumers of water for growing cotton while the upstream countries want to use more water for electricity generation and fanning. Accordingly, GMCR II is utilized as a formal mechanism for better understanding the complex conflict existing at present among countries along the Syr Darya and for providing insights as to how these countries may interact with one another in attempting to reach a resolution acceptable to all. In particular, strictly following the present water allocation agreement by all parties is found to be the most preferred resolution for both the upstream and downstream countries.

J	Rego, LC; dos Santos, AM				Rego, Leandro Chaves; dos Santos, Andrea Maria			Upper and lower probabilistic preferences in the graph model for conflict resolution	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Conflict; Graph model; Stability notions; Upper and lower probabilities; Preference uncertainty; Imprecise probabilistic preferences	UNCERTAINTY; SYSTEMS	We propose a model where decision makers may express their preferences among the possible conflict scenarios using upper and lower probabilities in the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR). In this new model, we propose eight stability definitions (solution concepts) that are generalizations of the four stability concepts commonly used in the GMCR model, namely: cautious alpha-Nash stability, risky a-Nash stability, cautious (alpha, beta)-metarationality, risky (alpha, beta)-metarationality, cautious (alpha, beta)-symmetric meta rationality, risky (alpha,beta)-symmetric metarationality, cautious (alpha, beta)-sequential stability and risky (alpha, beta, gamma)-sequential stability. We present these definitions for conflicts with two or more decision makers and also for conflicts in which the decision makers act as a coalition and analyze the relationship between them. We present two applications and perform the stability analysis using the proposed model to illustrate the gains obtained when individuals are allowed to have the uncertainty about their own preferences expressed by upper and lower probabilities.

Marc; Obeidi, Amer			Interval fuzzy preferences in the graph model for conflict resolution	FUZZY OPTIMIZATION AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Graph model; Interval fuzzy preference; Interval fuzzy stability; Interval fuzzy equilibrium		A new analysis technique, appropriate to situations of high preference uncertainty, is added to the graph model for conflict resolution methodology. Interval fuzzy stabilities are now formulated, based on decision makers' (DMs') interval fuzzy preferences over feasible scenarios or states in a conflict. Interval fuzzy stability notions enhance the applicability of the graph model, and generalize its crisp and fuzzy preference-based stability ideas. A graph model is both a formal representation and an analysis procedure for multiple participant-multiple objective decisions that employs stability concepts representing various forms of human behavior under conflict. Defined based on a type-2 fuzzy logic, an interval fuzzy preference for one state over another is represented by a subinterval of [0, 1] indicating an interval-valued preference degree for the first state over the second. The interval fuzzy stabilities put forward in this research are interval fuzzy Nash stability, interval fuzzy general metarational stability, interval fuzzy symmetric metarational stability, and interval fuzzy sequential stability. A state is interval fuzzy stable for a DM if moving to any other state is not adequately desirable to the DM; where adequacy is measured by the interval fuzzy satisficing threshold of the DM and farsightedness, involving possible moves and countermoves by DMs, is determined by the interval fuzzy stability notion selected. Note that infinitely many degrees in an interval-valued preference are preserved in characterizing the desirability of a move. A state from which no DM can move to any sufficiently desirable scenario is an interval fuzzy equilibrium, and is interpreted as a possible resolution of the strategic conflict under study. The new stability concept is illustrated through its application to an environmental conflict that took place in Elmira, Ontario, Canada. Insightful results are identified and discussed.	[Bashar, M.

J	Yasmeen, H; Tan, QM; Ali, S; Ismail, H				Yasmeen, Humaira; Tan, Qingmei; Ali, Sharafat; Ismail, Hina			Managing environmental quality in Pakistan through sustainable development of energy-economy-environment (3E): insights from graph model of conflict resolution (GMCR)	MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article						Environmental quality; GMCR; Energy; Economy; Sustainable development; Conflict resolution	FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT; EMISSION-REDUCTION; CIRCULAR ECONOMY; CONSUMPTION; GROWTH; INDUSTRY; URBANIZATION; FRAMEWORK; ATTITUDE; PROMOTE	Purpose The sustainable development of the energy-economy-environment (3E) needs to ensure the balanced interplay between the energy-economy and the environment. Likewise, creating such balance has become a critical policy issue among countries worldwide. However, in the past, studies have ignored to create a balanced interplay of the energy-economy and environment. Therefore, to address said research gap, this paper aims to develop a graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR)-based strategy for the sustainable development of the 3E to ensure better environmental quality. Design/methodology/approach To develop a strategic framework for the balanced interplay between the energy-economy and the environment, the study used the GMCR approach and designed a mechanism for the sustainable development of the 3E to ensure better environmental quality in the context of Pakistan. Findings The results from the GMCR indicate that sustainable development of the 3E to ensure better environmental quality is possible when government focuses on the sustainable growth of the economy through environmental policies and the use of renewable energy. Practical implications By solving the 3E conflict, this study provides policy insights for the government of Pakistan for the sustainable development of the energy economy and the environment to ensure better environmental quality in the country. Originality/value For the first time, this paper tried to put forward a way through which conflicting objectives can be achieved together for the sustainable development of the 3E to ensure better environmental quality.

In addition to effects of the transboundary factors, internal factors such as management disputes, contradiction of goals in different organization and ministries has resulted to eliminate some area of Hour Al-Azim wetland and dust storm phenomenon. In this study, the non-cooperative game theoretic and conflict model GMCR II (Graph Model for Conflict Resolution) were used to resolve the internal management conflicts. After determining players, strategies and priorities of each player were identified by using of the AHP-SWOT model (Analytic hierarchy process (AHP), The Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT)). Then, with respect to the required limitations, 120 states were created in the conflict. In the following, appropriate solution approach was selected by running the model and determining equilibrium points. According to the results, endorsing supporting ideas for farmers, improving of crop pattern, imposing crop cultivation limitation by Ministry of Agriculture, preventing from oil field expansion and better agricultural water supply for integrated management of the region were identified as solutions to resolve conflicts among players. On the other hand, Department of Environment should also impose more rigorous regulations on development of oil fields in the region.

To accomplish this, the concept of a full coalition set is defined in which each participating decision maker (DM) is represented once either as an individual player or part of a coalition. All possible scenarios in which a full coalition set could be formed is called the universal coalition set. When calculating the stability of a specific state for a particular coalition in a given conflict, the remaining DMs form the universal coalition set whose moves have the potential to block any CIs by the focal coalition within four specified solution concepts having full participation of sanctioning opponents. To handle heterogeneous opponents with mixed CIs (MCIs), the mixed coalition analysis approach is proposed, which provides a more general coalition analysis framework than existing coalition analysis approaches. Moreover, the interrelationships among coalitional stabilities and mixed coalitional stabilities with full participation are investigated followed by their corresponding matrix representations which can significantly improve their computational efficiency and make the computer implementation possible. Finally, a case study is investigated to demonstrate how to employ the proposed mixed coalition analysis approaches to address a real-world environmental conflict.

Coalition stability analysis within a graph model provides guidance for decision makers and analysts by providing an assessment of whether states that are individually stable are unstable for coalitions. In using the graph model method for conflict resolution one carries out stability analysis of a graph model, and then follows up with post-stability analysis, an important component of which is coalition analysis. Although basic coalition stabilities have been defined for the graph model, they are based on a transitive graph, which is inconsistent with the standard restriction in the graph model. Algorithms for implementing these coalition stabilities have not been developed, because the nature of their logical representations makes coding difficult. Additionally, existing coalition stabilities apply only to simple preference, which limits their utility for exploring more complicated applications in practice. In this paper, coalition stabilities are extended to include uncertain preference and represented using matrices, which are more effective and convenient for computer implementation and for adaptation to new analysis techniques.

Marc			Analyzing market competition between Airbus and Boeing using a duo hierarchical graph model for conflict resolution	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Hierarchical Graph Model; Airbus and Boeing; stability results; strategic resolutions	WATER DIVERSION CONFLICTS; DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; COALITION ANALYSIS; PREFERENCE; CHINA	A duo hierarchical graph model for conflict resolution is developed to investigate market competition between Airbus and Boeing over aircraft sales in the Asia Pacific region. The duo hierarchical graph model, a significant extension of the graph model for conflict resolution methodology, contains two common decision makers, who take part in two related subconflicts, as well as local decision makers, who participate in only one subconflict. New stability definitions are proposed to describe forms of sanction unique to the hierarchical model. The interrelationships between stabilities in the overall graph model and in the two local models are investigated. Then the duo hierarchical graph model is applied to the competition between Airbus and Boeing in both the wide and narrow body markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The two types of Asian airlines have different operating strategies, so that the two markets constitute sub-competitions that can be modelled naturally using the duo hierarchical graph model. The stability results indicate a resolution for all decision makers that implies marketing strategies for the aircraft manufacturers and guidelines for aircraft purchase by the airlines. Thus, this model provides decision makers with a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the competition and guidance in identifying beneficial actions.

J	Williams, C; Fang, Liping				Williams, Colin; Fang, Liping			A Value-Focused Multiple Participant-Multiple Criteria (MPMC) Decision Support Approach for Public Policy Formulation	GROUP DECISION AND NEGOTIATION			English	Article						Multiple participant-multiple criteria (MPMC) decision making; Participant; Public policy; Stakeholder; Strategic alignment; Values	CONFLICT-RESOLUTION; STAKEHOLDERS; SYSTEM; THINKING; MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; MODEL	A decision support framework for policy formulation that incorporates a value-focused, multiple participant-multiple criteria (MPMC) approach is presented to address the systemic over-reliance of financial assessments as the primary decision support model. The proposed approach provides a robust decision support framework for aiding complex public decision-making processes involving conflicting multiple decision-makers (as participants) and values. Participant values are used to determine viable options which in turn determine feasible policy recommendations. Values also determine participant preferences. Through the application of the Graph Model of Conflict Resolution, policy-makers can generate viable and stable policy recommendations. In contrast to focusing solely on alternatives, this framework ensures that policy-makers review scenarios that align with organizational values and objectives, thereby producing informed policy decisions. Further, the framework is applied within a case study involving the City of Toronto, Canada, where policy recommendations to privatize curbside waste collection services were being considered. The framework incorporates multiple participant perspectives and their associated criteria, in lieu of traditional financial assessments (e.g., cost-benefit analysis). This study further demonstrates the usefulness and practicality of incorporating a value-focused, MPMC approach for the derivation of good public policy.

China's Photovoltaic (PV) Poverty Reduction Program provides an archetype model to address those two questions simultaneously. Using a tripartite game of government, enterprise and household, this paper examines the challenges that have impeded the development of China's PV poverty alleviation program. Based on an evolutionary game model and the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) model involving the three major parties, this study shows that: (1) Governmental monitoring and the active participation of both enterprises and households are essential to achieve a win-win-win outcome; (2) the government plays a leading role in monitoring and encouraging the active participation of enterprises and households and resolving the conflicts between enterprises and households; and (3) households should have a minimum share in the project. The analyses imply the following policy suggestions such as ensuring optimal path selection for all parties, avoiding the abandonment of projects, increasing households' sense of ownership and creating accessible finance.

Marc			Turbulence in Miramichi Bay: The burnt church conflict over native fishing rights	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Summer Specialty Conference of the American-Water-Resources-Association	JUN, 2005	Honolulu, HI	Amer Water Resources Assoc		Graph Model for Conflict Resolution; conflict analysis; decision support system; First Nations; fisheries; planning; sustainability; emotion	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; WATER-RESOURCES; MODEL	A systematic technique is proposed for assisting in the design and implementation of policy and addressing the need to minimize or resolve disputes that may arise in the enforcement of regulations. The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution is a methodology that facilitates the modeling and analysis of interactive multiple participant-multiple objective decision problems. In the problems considered here, decision makers and policy planners engaged in capacity building typically have different viewpoints over appropriate ways of developing options and enforcing policy choices. Incompatible understandings of resource potentials and limits, and disparities in utilization of these resources, exasperate stakeholders and make the capacity building process counterproductive and even conducive to conflict. A systematic conflict resolution technique is invaluable to policy makers and practitioners in defusing confrontations and reaching out for consensus among participants. In support of current approaches to policy planning and regulation, the Graph Model provides accurate predictions and strategic insights into short- and long-term opportunities in multiple participant-multiple objective decision situations. A conflict among the government of Canada, the Mi'kmaq First Nation, and commercial fishermen over the sharing of a natural resource in New Brunswick, Canada, is used to illustrate the advantages of this technique in practical problems.

Enhancing National Security and Energy Security in the Post-911 Era: Group Decision Support for Strategic Policy Analysis under Conditions of Conflict	GROUP DECISION AND NEGOTIATION			English	Article						Environmental risk; Decision support; Energy security; Graph model for conflict resolution	GRAPH MODEL; SYSTEM	Energy source diversity has become a fundamental principle of both US energy security and national security. The decision of whether or not to approve a new power plant facility in the US involves complex group decision and negotiation processes. These contentious, value-laden, and multi-faceted self organizing processes involve many decision makers (broad constituencies) with conflicting priorities and dynamic preferences, high decision stakes, limited technical information (both in terms of quality and quantity), and difficult tradeoffs. As population pressures and energy demands continue to mount, advances in conflict resolution can help to improve power plant siting processes as well as US energy security and national security. Specifically, this paper uses advances in the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution and its associated decision support system (DSS) GMCR II to analyze strategic aspects of a multi-party energy dispute involving the co-management of a shared air shed in the Fraser Lowland Eco-Region based on Sumas Energy 2 (SE2), a contentious power plant project proposed for the US side of the international border between the city of Abbotsford, British Columbia and town of Sumas, Washington. GMCR II provides strategic insights for enhancing energy security, national security, and environmental risk management in the United States.

Fuzzy real options analysis is employed to evaluate risky projects where the value of managerial flexibility cannot be overlooked. For civil engineering project evaluation, OWA is used to estimate the parameters of the fuzzy real options model, such as initial values and volatilities, to reflect the risk preference of decision makers (DMs). Because it can take into account DMs' values and preferences for a risky project, GMCR is utilized to identify equilibria, or potential resolutions of the conflict, among all possible states, or combinations of DMs' choices. While an option pricing model is employed to estimate the values of decision makers (DMs) toward a risky project, all parts are integrated via fuzzy functions in this framework. A brownfield redevelopment case, the Ralgreen Community in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, is used as a typical risky project to demonstrate how to apply this integrated approach. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the comprehensive use of fuzzy methods to assess brownfield projects. For this purpose, stochastic methods face difficulties because risks cannot be fully reflected in market prices. Expert knowledge that is descriptive, multi-attribute, or subjective in nature can be effectively quantified using fuzzy representations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Hypergame theory, as developed within the framework of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution for handling misperceptions, is used to gain strategic insights into these conflicts and to ascertain the possible resolutions of the disputes. In all of three conflicts, the key decision makers are Egypt and Sudan, the downstream countries, and Ethiopia, the upstream nation. The findings from the analyses demonstrate the significant utilization of strategic surprise, a decisive act in which a decision maker intentionally exercises a course of action in the dispute that is hidden to its opponents in order to attempt to reach a more desirable outcome for itself. In particular, both Egypt and Sudan were caught by surprise when Ethiopia publicly announced on April 11, 2011 that it was going to build GERD, since no prior notification was given. Because Ethiopia was aware of Egypt and Sudan's misperception this dispute is modeled as a second level hypergame. The conflict investigations also show that the geopolitical and economic changes in Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia allowed Ethiopia to construct the dam without any harsh confrontation with Egypt and Sudan.

J	Ke, GY; li, kevin w.; hipel, keith william				Ke, Ginger Y.; Li, Kevin W.; hipel, keith william			An integrated multiple criteria preference ranking approach to the Canadian west coast port congestion conflict	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						AHP; Integrative conflict analysis; Graph model; Canadian west coast port congestion; Preference	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; GRAPH MODEL; RESOLUTION; AHP	An integrative conflict analysis approach, incorporating an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based preference ranking method into the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR), is employed to investigate the Canadian west coast port congestion dispute. The Canadian west coast has historically been an important gateway connecting North America to Asia thanks to its specific geographical and strategic location. Despite successful operations and maintenance of the port facilities to handle international trade during the past few decades, the west coast is now facing increasing congestion problems, resulting in significant delays in transporting goods from the west coast to other parts of Canada and the USA. The strategic analyses carried out in this research suggest potential resolutions in which Canada would expand port facilities at various locations, encouraging traders to continue choosing the Canadian west coast as one of their trade gateways to North America.

J	Wu, NN; Xu, YJ; kilgour, d. marc				Wu, Nannan; Xu, Yejun; Kilgour, D. Marc			Water Allocation Analysis of the Zhanghe River Basin Using the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution with Incomplete Fuzzy Preferences	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						water resource allocation; graph model for conflict resolution; incomplete fuzzy preferences; additive transitivity	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; CONSISTENCY; METHODOLOGY; PRIORITY; DISPUTE	An incomplete fuzzy preference framework for the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) is proposed to handle both complete and incomplete fuzzy preference information. Usually, decision makers' (DMs') fuzzy preferences are assumed to be complete fuzzy preference relations (FPRs). However, in real-life situations, due to lack of information or limited expertise in the problem domain, any DM's preference may be an incomplete fuzzy preference relation (IFPR). An inherent advantage of the proposed framework for GMCR is that it can complete the IFPRs based on additive consistency, which is a special form of transitivity, a common property of preferences. After introducing the concepts of FPR, IFPR, and transitivity, we propose an algorithm to supplement IFPR, that is, to find an FPR that is a good approximation. To illustrate the usefulness of the incomplete fuzzy preference framework for GMCR, we demonstrate it using to a real-world conflict over water allocation that took place in the Zhanghe River basin of China.

This formal systems investigation reveals that a win/win resolution occurs when the downstream provinces of Henan and Hebei agree to cooperate to purchase water at a proper price from the upstream province of Shanxi. This resolution is possible with upgraded infrastructure and with facilitation by the Zhanghe River Upstream Management Bureau. Moreover, an integrated water management system for the entire watershed is recommended.

Marc; costa, ana paula cabral seixas			Strategic Analysis of a Regulatory Conflict Using Dempster-Shafer Theory and AHP for Preference Elicitation	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Regulatory conflict; graph model for conflict resolution; absence of preference information; DST-AHP	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; GRAPH MODEL; COALITION ANALYSIS; DERIVING WEIGHTS; RESOLUTION; MATRICES; DS/AHP	Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) are integrated in order to elicit preference information from experts regarding decision makers (DMs) involved in a regulatory conflict. More precisely, DST is used for combining expert knowledge regarding preferences of a specific DM(the regulatory body), and AHP is employed for ranking feasible states in the conflict for this same DM. In order to illustrate how this preference elicitation proposal can be conveniently implemented in practice within the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR), it is applied to a real construction dispute located in the city of Ipojuca, Brazil. The conflict is modeled with three DMs: support, opposition, and the regulatory body. Results show that the new preference methodology possesses many inherent advantages including high flexibility, the ability to capture uncertainty or even ignorance about preferences, the possibility of combining expert knowledge with respect to missing preferences, and a substantial reduction in the number of pairwise comparisons of states required to express preference information.

J	He, SW				He, Shawei			Coalition Analysis in Basic Hierarchical Graph Model for Conflict Resolution with Application to Climate Change Governance Disputes	GROUP DECISION AND NEGOTIATION			English	Article						Hierarchical graph model; Conflict resolution; Coalition analysis; Climate change governance	WATER DIVERSION CONFLICTS; DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; PREFERENCE; GAMES; ATTITUDES; EMISSION; CHINA	The coalition in interrelated conflicts with hierarchical structures is analyzed within the framework of basic hierarchical graph model as an extension of graph model for conflict resolution. A basic hierarchical graph model consists of two local graph models with three decision makers: one common decision maker supervising both local graph models, and two local decision makers, each of whom takes part in one local graph model. Two types of coalition, between the common and one local decision maker, and between two local decision makers are discussed. Theorems are proposed, indicating that transition from one equilibrium to another, called equilibrium jump, can only take place in the coalition consisting of common and local decision maker. The change to a more preferred equilibrium for local decision makers could only take place when they temporarily sacrifice their interests. An illustrative example of hierarchical disputes over achieving emission goals between the national and two provincial governments in China are investigated. The results suggest that agreements between the national and one provincial government can be reached. The province will achieve stricter emission goals when being subsidized by the national government. Agreements between the two provinces cannot be formed without the participation of the national government. This study can provide courses of action for decision makers under coalition in dealing with hierarchical conflicts.

J	Yousefi, S; hipel, keith william; Hegazy, T				yousefi, saied; hipel, keith william; hegazy, tarek			Attitude-based conflict management for resolving disputes over water quality of the Seymareh River in Iran	SCIENTIA IRANICA			English	Article						Systems engineering; Conflict; Management; Methodology; Graph model	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; NEGOTIATION; FUTURE; MODEL	A strategic negotiation methodology for managing complex water-related conflicts is presented in order to consider the decision makers' attitudes. The developed approach systematically exploits the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) as an analytical and practical technique, and helps decision makers find the most beneficial outcomes for negotiating their disputes, assuming the competing needs, wants, and attitudes of decision makers. A real case study of a water-related dispute in Iran is used to demonstrate the implementation of the developed methodology and to emphasize the significance of decision makers' attitudes in identifying feasible negotiation outcomes for resolving complex disputes. In fact, the developed attitude-oriented methodology proposes an innovative engineering approach to help stakeholders address a wide range of conflicts, especially in complex water disputes in developing countries where human factors such as attitude play a significant role. The research can also help decision makers with the shortcomings of conventional decision making systems, such as original GMCR, through incorporating attitudes into conflict resolution tools in order to better clarify needs and interests, obtain equilibrium results, and generate more equitable solutions.

In this paper, preference structures for decision makers in a hierarchical graph model are established, and theorems are developed that elucidate the relationship between stabilities in the overall (hierarchical) model and stabilities in the component submodels. To illustrate, the hierarchical graph model is applied to greenhouse gas emission disputes between USA and China, where local decision makers in the USA are the two parties in Congress, and local decision makers in China are state-owned energy companies. The stability results suggest potential strategic resolutions of bilateral disputes, and how parties can attain them. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study is to present a dynamic evolutionary analysis model for simulating the behavior of different water users and solving the problem of transboundary water conflicts. To accomplish this goal, a revenue function, which can objectively evaluate the relative preferences of different DMs in water conflicts, was constructed to improve the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR) model. A demonstration area in the Yangtze River Delta on ecologically friendly development (DAYRD) in China is applied to demonstrate the applicability of the improved method. The results show that the improved GMCR model based on the revenue function can accurately simulate the dynamic evolution of transboundary water conflicts and avoid the influence of subjective factors of researchers or experts in the traditional method. Additionally, the results indicated that water conflicts in the DAYRD can be transformed from the status quo (conflict) to the target state (cooperation) by effectively controlling the intensity of third-party intervention. These findings provide useful insights for the resolution of transboundary water conflicts and enhance our understanding of the role of third parties in transforming conflict into cooperation.

J	Mehrparvar, M; Ahmadi, A; Safavi, HR				Mehrparvar, Milad; Ahmadi, Azadeh; Safavi, Hamid Reza			Resolving water allocation conflicts using WEAP simulation model and non-cooperative game theory	SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Non-cooperative game theory; water resources allocation; WEAP simulation model; graph model conflict resolution	RESOURCES ALLOCATION; DECISION-MAKING; PART 1; EQUILIBRIA; PREFERENCE; RESOLUTION	Disparity in water supply and demand often leads to conflicts among users over water resources in basins. Game theory is a new tool recently employed for resolving such conflicts. The present study uses non-cooperative games to resolve the conflicts in the Zayandehroud basin. The games are simulated between two stakeholders by the graph model conflict resolution (GMCR) method as one of the non-cooperative methods. The stakeholders are Isfahan Regional Water Company (IRWC) and Agriculture-Jahad Organization (AJO). Stakeholders can execute some strategies competitively, which include A: developing farming lands, B: improving irrigation efficiency, C: controlling withdrawals from aquifers, and D: selling water to the industrial sector. A and B are executed by AJO and C and D are executed by IRWC. The sustainable water allocation scenarios are obtained by GMCR and employed in a water evaluation and planning simulation model to supply consumers' water demand. The best sustainable scenario selected based on GMCR concepts requires irrigation efficiency of agricultural lands to be improved in order to achieve a demand meeting index of 90% and, in contrast, there will be not control on water withdrawal from aquifers.

J	Zhao, SN; Xu, HY				Zhao, Shinan; Xu, Haiyan			A Novel Preference Elicitation Technique Based on a Graph Model and Its Application to a Brownfield Redevelopment Conflict in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						graph model for conflict resolution; conflict analysis; preference elicitation; brownfield redevelopment conflicts	INTERVAL FUZZY PREFERENCES; DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; OPTION PRIORITIZATION; MANAGEMENT; STRENGTH	Disputes are very common and pervasive in brownfield redevelopment projects, in which multiple stakeholders or decision-makers (DMs) strategically interact with each other with a conflict of interest. The preference information of DMs involved plays a vital role in identifying possible outcomes or resolutions for resolving a tough brownfield conflict. In this research, a novel preference ranking technique is purposefully proposed within the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR) paradigm to effectively and accurately garner DMs' actual preferences, in which states are ranked according to their similarities and closeness to the most and least preferred states instead of subjective option statements or weights in traditional preference ranking methods. Finally, a real-world brownfield conflict which occurred in China is utilized to show how the proposed preference ranking method can be applied for conveniently obtaining the true preference information of DMs and strategically determining the equilibria of a given dispute. The case study indicates that the novel preference elicitation approach is more objective and reasonable than the traditional option prioritization method. Moreover, there exists an equilibrium which can provide strategic advice and meaningful insights for addressing the brownfield conflict.

To identify the mixed coalitional movements, mixed unilateral improvements (Wits) are constructed in this research followed by a specific example. Subsequently, two types of mixed stabilities are developed within the GMCR paradigm for conveniently portraying different sanctioning behavior of heterogeneous opponents. Compared to general metarationality (GMR), symmetric metarationality (SMR) and sequential stability (SEQ), mixed stabilities take into account different sanctioning moves by opponents, which is more practical and useful for investigating real-world disputes. Furthermore, the interrelationships among mixed stabilities and four classical stabilities are discussed. Subsequently, equilibria with mixed stabilities are proposed, in which each decision maker may adopt a different solution concept defining his or her behavior. To enhance the efficiency of mixed stability calculations, the algebraic representations of mixed stabilities are then constructed. Finally, a generic environmental conflict in China is utilized to demonstrate how mixed stabilities can be employed to effectively address an actual dispute with heterogeneous opponents.

The algorithms based on integer programming enable a DM, an analyst, or a mediator to obtain all of the preferences required to make a specified state to be an equilibrium or resolution. For the cases of Nash, GMR, and SMR, the respective inverse algorithm for the focal DM is formulated as a 0-1 integer linear programming problem even when both DMs' preferences are unknown. For the situation of SEQ, when both DMs' preferences are unknown, the focal DM's algorithm is a 0-1 integer nonlinear programming problem while, under the condition that the opponent's preferences are known, the focal DM's 0-1 integer programming problem is linear. The usefulness of the algorithms developed is demonstrated by applying them to an illustrative dispute.

This paper uses the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution methodology to model a conflict based on the Nash solution concept, General Meta-Rationality, Symmetric Meta-Rationality, Sequential Stability, Limited h Move Stability, and Non-Myopic Stability definitions and then sieve the socially optimal outcomes from the results of the graph model. We propose to add a new analytical stage as a sequential next step to the equilibria in the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution and utilize social choice voting rules such as the Borda score, the Plurality rule, the Median voting rule, Copeland's method, Simpson's rule, and Fallback bargaining. We also apply a new approach called Related games, where we show how the Leading game impacts the Consequential game's outcome and equilibria. To demonstrate the proposed concepts, we applied these ideas to two case studies; (1) the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers conflict between Turkey, Syria, and Iraq, and (2) the Shatt al-Arab, which is on the border of Iran and Iraq. Results confirm that adding analytical stages in the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution and considering the Related games concept help decision and policy makers to gain a clearer insight into the conflict.

J	Xiao, Y; hipel, keith william; Fang, Liping				Xiao, Yi; hipel, keith william; Fang, Liping			Strategic Investigation of the Jackpine Mine Expansion Dispute in the Alberta Oil Sands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Decision Support System; Development; Graph Model for Conflict Resolution; Jackpine Mine Expansion; Oil Sands		The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) methodology is employed to ascertain strategic insights into a serious conflict over environmental concerns connected to the expanded exploitation of oil sands at the Jackpine Mine Expansion project located in Alberta, Canada. In fact, the expansion of extracting bitumen from large tracts of oil sands in Alberta and its associated potential negative environmental impacts have received increasing attention at the global level. Accordingly, environmentally responsible extended mining of bitumen at the Jackpine site is urgently needed. Hence, the GMCR methodology and its associated decision support system GMCR II are utilized to systematically investigate the conflict of the Jackpine Mine Expansion project. The results imply that the Federal Government of Canada is more concerned about the economic benefits generated by the oil sands projects rather than environmental impacts. It is suggested that more effort should be devoted to the environment conservation by the government.

The matrix methods are used to determine more easily the stable states according to five stability definitions proposed for this model, namely: alpha-Nash stability, (alpha, beta)-metarationality, (alpha, beta)-symmetric metarationality, (alpha, beta, gamma)-sequential stability and (alpha, beta, gamma)-symmetric sequential stability. With the help of such methods, we are able to analyze for which values of parameters alpha, beta and gamma the states satisfy each one of these stability notions. These parameters regions can be used to compare the equilibrium robustness of the states. As a byproduct of our method, we point out an existing problem in the literature regarding matrix representation of solution concepts in the GMCR.

J	Ali, S; Xu, HY; Xu, P; Ahmed, W				Ali, Sharafat; Xu, Haiyan; Xu, Peng; Ahmed, Waqas			Evolutional Attitude Based on Option Prioritization for Conflict Analysis of Urban Transport Planning in Pakistan	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Urban planning; infrastructure management; heritage protection; decision making; evolutional attitudes; conflict management; evolutional GMCR	GRAPH MODEL; ENGAGEMENT; RESOLUTION; MANAGEMENT; LAHORE	This paper constructs a dynamic conflict model that considers Decision Makers' (DMs) evolutional attitude using the option prioritization. The proposed evolutional attitude approach is based on the framework of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR). Compared with the existing state-based preference, the option prioritization is a more convenient and efficient approach to analyze larger models with consideration of the evolutional attitude, which exists broadly in the evolutional conflicts in real-life. This study reveals how the evolutional attitude of a DM succeeds in the overall evolution of conflict. The analysis unfolds that DMs change their attitude(s) consequent upon the changes in DMs and options available to them as conflict evolves from one level to the next. The changes in attitude of DMs during dynamic conflict situation have substantial effects on the equilibrium outcomes of a conflict. The proposed evaluation attitude-based approach is employed to analyze the conflict between the Punjab Government (G) and Heritage Campaigner and the Public (P) in Pakistan that appeared due to the inappropriate design, planning, and construction of an urban transport system project in Lahore, Pakistan. The present study demonstrates the modeling procedure of a two-level evolutional attitude-based conflict analysis. The results of the stability analysis reveal that improper (negative) attitude may result in undesirable and unexpected consequences, such as project temporalities and delays. This research provides a foundation for future research in urban project planning that employs strategic ways to avoid disputes caused by DMs' attitudes.

Marc; hipel, keith william			Strategic analysis of a brownfield revitalization conflict using the grey-based graph model for conflict resolution	EURO JOURNAL ON DECISION PROCESSES			English	Article						Grey preference; Graph model for conflict resolution; Multiple decision makers; Brownfield redevelopment		A definition of grey preference, based on grey numbers, is incorporated into a multiple decision-maker graph model for conflict resolution, to model human behaviour in a strategic conflict featuring uncertainty-in this case, a dispute arising over brownfield redevelopment. To analyse a strategic conflict, the relative preferences of each decision maker over all feasible states are required for a stability analysis. However, because of incomplete information, cognitive limitations of decision makers, the interplay of stakeholders and sheer complexity, it can be hard to capture accurately the preferences of all decision makers across all possible scenarios or states. Moreover, analysis is difficult when more than two decision makers are involved, as coordinated moves against a focal decision maker must be taken into account when identifying stable states. In this paper, a grey preference structure is used to represent decision makers' uncertain preferences in a graph model. Then two types of grey stability (grey Nash stability and grey sequential stability) and corresponding equilibria are calculated for a model of a brownfield redevelopment conflict that occurred in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada.

J	Zhao, JS; Xu, HY; Yang, BH				Zhao, Jinshuai; Xu, Haiyan; Yang, Baohua			Dynamic Interaction Method for Group Decision Making with Interval Grey Numbers based on GMCR	JOURNAL OF GREY SYSTEM			English	Article						Conflict Resolution; Dynamic Interaction; Group Decision Making; Graph Model; Interval Grey Numbers	CONFLICT-RESOLUTION; SUPPORT-SYSTEM; GRAPH MODEL; INFORMATION; WEIGHT; MAKERS	This paper studies the problem of how to determine a satisfying alternative of all decision makers (DMs) in multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM), which uses interval grey numbers as attribute values, and the weights of DMs are unknown. The ranking of alternatives of different DMs in group decision making are usually inconsistent, which creates conflict among DMs. To deal with this conflict, the indispensible conflict elements in MAGDM are extracted from the framework of the graph model for conflict resolution which in turn can provide an approach to acquiring stable alternative for MAGDM. Then, a dynamic interaction mechanism is devised for unstable DMs in which their attribute values are adjusted gradually according to the conflict degree of each attribute. This will show the process of how various DMs reach consonant cognition via several rounds of information exchanges. The method in this article not only concerns all DMs' opinions but also avoids the influence of DMs' weight vectors to the final decision result. Finally, validity and practicality of the proposed method are verified through a practical example. Compared with some existing methods, this study provides a new framework to real world MAGDM problems.

Integrating an Option-Oriented Attitude Analysis into Investigating the Degree of Stabilities in Conflict Resolution	GROUP DECISION AND NEGOTIATION			English	Article						Attitude-driven analysis; Option-oriented; Degree of stabilities; Graph model for conflict resolution; Post-Fukushima controversy	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; GRAPH MODEL; PREFERENCE; STRENGTH; DISPUTE; JAPAN	Despite the influences on one's thoughts and actions, the attitude has usually been overlooked in conflict analysis. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new systematic methodology for the graph model for conflict resolution that can be employed to study real-world conflict situations and gain enhanced insights. More specifically, the proposed method starts with the development of an expanded option-oriented preference structure that is derived from decision makers' attitudes toward others. Then based on this attitude-driven preference structure, the general concepts of stabilities are extended to contain the definitions of different degrees of stabilities under attitude. In addition, the proposed method is embedded in a decision support system, called NUAAGMCR, to facilitate the analytical process. Through a detailed case study of the two-stage environmental conflict of post-Fukushima controversy in Japan, the predicted resolutions are demonstrated to be more accurate and stable than those derived by the general stability analysis.

Generally, the adjacency matrix represents a simple digraph and determines all paths between any two vertices, and is not readily extendable to colored multidigraphs. To bridge the gap, a conversion function is proposed to transform the original problem of searching edge-colored paths in a colored multidigraph to a standard problem of finding paths in a simple digraph. Moreover, edge weights can be used to represent some preference attribute. Its potentially wide realm of applicability is illustrated by a case study: status quo analysis in the graph model for conflict resolution. The explicit matrix function is more convenient than other graphical representations for computer implementation and for adapting to other applications. Additionally, the algebraic approach reveals the relationship between a colored multidigraph and a simple digraph, thereby providing new insights into algebraic graph theory. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Cross-border conflict resolution: sediment contamination dispute in Lake Roosevelt	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL			English	Article							DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM	A transboundary conflict between Canada and the United States due to slag contamination in Lake Roosevelt is formally studied using the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution. Three key decision makers (DMs) were identified: 1) Teck Cominco, the largest mining, mineral processing and metallurgical company in Canada; 2) the United States Environmental Protection Agency; and 3) the Colville Indian Tribes, whose traditional territories are located in the Lake Roosevelt area. After a careful background investigation, the conflict among these three groups is modeled by identifying three key DMs, potential courses of action for each DM, and the relative preferences of each DM with respect to the states or scenarios that could occur as of May 2006, just before the settlement agreement was signed. Subsequently, a stability analysis is carried out and several strong equilibria or potential solutions to the conflict are identified. The analytical results verify the suitability of the developed analytical model, suggest mutual agreements between the stakeholders as a potential solution for the conflict, and highlight the importance of establishing new or strictly enforcing existing water policies in order to resolve current conflicts and to avoid any future controversies.

In the current model, uncertainties in hydraulic conductivity and the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity of contaminants are considered using the Fuzzy Transformation Method (FTM). First, the BIOPLUME III simulation model is linked with a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) multi-objective optimization model to optimize a groundwater bioremediation system regarding conflicting viewpoints of decision makers. Then, the hydrogeological uncertainties of the groundwater bioremediation system are included in the proposed methodology using FTM. The three main objectives of the in-situ bioremediation optimization model are overall cost (well installation, treatment or pumping, and facility capital), the sum of contaminant concentration violating any standards, and contaminant plume fragmentation, which need to be minimized based on stakeholders' preferences. Subsequently, GMCR II is utilized to resolve any conflicts between the perspectives of the stakeholders to achieve a compromise solution. The performance assessment results represent the ability of the proposed methodology for optimal in-situ groundwater bioremediation. Results show that the minimum fuzzy interval is 323%, and pertains to the overall cost of the bioremediation system in fuzzy alpha-cut levels of 0 and 0.5. Conversely, the maximum fuzzy interval is related to contaminant plume fragmentation in fuzzy alpha-cut levels of 0 and 03, and was found to be 95.1%.

Specifically, matrix expressions are employed to represent DMs' reciprocal preference relations, unilateral movements (UMs) and fuzzy unilateral improvements (FUIs), as well as joint UMs and joint FUIs for a coalition of two or more DMs. Furthermore, a matrix methodology is provided to calculate whether a state in a conflict model, or scenario, is stable for a particular DM under various solution concepts, or stability definitions, that reflect the diversity of possible behavioral patterns for a DM in a conflict when preferences can be reciprocal. Five solution concepts associated with reciprocal preferences, Fuzzy Nash Stability, Fuzzy Symmetric Metarationality, Fuzzy General Metarationality, Fuzzy Sequential Stability, and Fuzzy Symmetric Sequential Stability, are redefined for matrix representations of both two-DM and multiple-DM conflict models. To illustrate how the matrix representation can be conveniently employed in practice, it is applied to two real-world conflicts. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

More specifically, a flexible four-process framework for capability-based SoS architecting containing interactive portfolio decision analysis to promote multistakeholder design negotiations on system portfolio selections is presented. By taking full advantage of the inherent realistic and flexible design of the GMCR paradigm, an interactive portfolio decision analysis approach is designed to facilitate the systematic modeling and analysis of system portfolio decisions at the SoS level in order to achieve potential compromises among all key stakeholders having disparate preferences and interacting according to different conflict behavior patterns. This approach permits the prediction of possible mutually agreeable system portfolios for SoS architecture development. Last, the feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated using an illustrative example.

The two national government are two decision makers at the top level. Within each nation, the two provincial governments negotiate with the national government at the lower level. The theoretical structure of this novel model, including decision makers, options, moves, and preference relations, are developed. The interrelationship between the stabilities in the two-level hierarchical graph model and the stabilities in local models are investigated by theorems. These theorems can be utilized to calculate complete stabilities in the two-level hierarchical graph model when the stabilities in local graph models are known. The international climate change negotiations as the illustrative example is then investigated in detail. The extra equilibrium, uniquely obtained by this novel methodology, suggests that opposition may still be from one provincial government when the national government does not sign the international climate agreement and implements existing environmental laws.

A fundamental construction is the metarational tree, which expresses DMs' interactions as sequences of rounds, each consisting of an initial move by the focal DM followed by countermoves by the opponents. Using the metarational tree, the stability definitions of the graph model for conflict resolution can be adapted to apply to policies. These generalized metarational stabilities are shown to generalize Nash, general metarational, and symmetric metarational stabilities. Relationships among generalized metarationalities are derived, as are their connections with policy equilibria. Finally, the refinement that allows only credible moves (moves that are in the immediate interest of the mover) produces a new family of credible generalized metarational stabilities that generalizes the concept of sequential stability in the graph model.

Despite the generally favourable conclusions of this review, the government delayed making a decision on the future of the industry for more than 2 years. This issue is examined using a graph model for conflict resolution. The graph model requires only ordinal preferences for the decision-makers and allows the analyst to impose realistic constraints on the conflict such as providing for unidirectional and common moves. Given the preferences of the players involved in the conflict, inaction on the part of the provincial government was a stable solution for 2 years. The deteriorating economic situation in British Columbia combined with an improved public acceptance of the salmon farming industry shifted the solution to one of adopting the recommendations from the environmental assessment review and eventually lifting the moratorium.

This research integrates into a unified framework two recent expansions of the graph model for conflict resolution, preference uncertainty and status quo analysis. Both of these developments enhance the applicability of the graph model, preference uncertainty by accommodating uncertainty in DMs' preferences and status quo analysis by addressing the dynamics of conflict. The combination of preference uncertainty and status quo analysis improves the flexibility of the graph model in both modelling and analysis. A new model of an environmental conflict is analyzed to demonstrate how the new algorithm can be applied.

This hierarchical graph model combines two component graph models. The theoretical framework of the combined model is constructed using the decision makers, states, moves, and preference structures from the component models. Theorems are developed to relate stable states in the hierarchical model to stable states in local graph models. This novel approach can avoid direct calculation for four hierarchical stabilities. This methodology is applied to a water diversion conflict in China, consisting of conflicts at two locations where it is proposed to divert water from the south to the north of the country.

This structure offers decision makers a more flexible mechanism for preference expression, which can include strong or mild preference of one state or scenario over another, as well as equal preference. In addition, preference between two states can be uncertain. The result is a preference framework that is more general than existing models which consider preference strength and preference uncertainty separately. Within the hybrid preference structure, four kinds of stability are defined as solution concepts and a post-stability analysis, called status quo analysis, which can be used to track the evolution of a given conflict. Algorithms are provided for implementing the key inputs of stability analysis and status quo analysis within the extended preference structure. The new stability concepts under the hybrid preference structure can be used to model complex strategic conflicts arising in practical applications, and can provide new insights for the conflicts. The method is illustrated using the conflict over proposed bulk water exports from Lake Gisborne in Newfoundland, Canada.

Higher-order Sequential Stabilities in the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution for Bilateral Conflicts	GROUP DECISION AND NEGOTIATION			English	Article						Conflict; Graph model; Stability notions; Non-credible threats	GENERALIZED METARATIONALITIES; FUZZY PREFERENCES; ATTITUDES; STRENGTH	The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) is a flexible model and has been widely used for describing and analyzing conflicts. Stability analysis is used in the GMCR to determine possible solutions for the conflict. Several solution concepts have been proposed which accommodate different decision makers' (DMs) behavior. Some of them are: Nash, General Metarationality (GMR) and Sequential Stability (SEQ). For a state to be Nash stable for a DM, such DM cannot move to a more preferred state in a single step. For GMR and SEQ, while considering moving to a more preferred state, the DM foresees whether the opponent can react leading the conflict to a state not preferred to the current one. What differs GMR and SEQ is that, in SEQ the opponent's move simultaneously sanctions the focal DM and benefits the opponent. We show, by means of an example, that there are situations in which the opponent's reaction is implausible in the sense that it involves the opponent leaving an SEQ stable state for him. In order to avoid that problem, we propose new solution concepts for the GMCR, called Higher-order Sequential Stabilities, and explore their relation with other solution concepts commonly used in the GMCR.

J	Du, JL; Liu, Y; Forrest, JYL				Du, Jun-Liang; Liu, Yong; Forrest, Jeffrey Yi-Lin			An interactive group decision model for selecting treatment schemes for mitigating air pollution	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Air pollution; Scheme selection; Conflict resolution; Grey incidence analysis; Equilibrium scheme	INTERVAL FUZZY PREFERENCES; GRAPH MODEL; CONFLICT-RESOLUTION; HEALTH-BENEFITS; CHINA; MANAGEMENT; QUALITY; ENERGY; POLICY; HAZE	Air pollution has caused huge losses of life and property. So, how to choose a practically effective scheme to m.itigate air pollution is of great significance. However, such a selection problem of treatment schemes represents really a group negotiation process of many decision makers (DMs), involving a variety of fuzzy information and preferences. To successfully address this selection problem, this paper proposes a novel group negotiation decision model by jointly employing various approaches, such as hesitant fuzzy set, grey target, grey incidence analysis, and graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR). Then, this model is used to determine the equilibrium schemes for treating air pollution. It is expected that this work provides a method for Chinese government to introduce programs to target air pollution control.

J	Tang, M; Liao, HC				Tang, Ming; Liao, Huchang			A graph model for conflict resolution with inconsistent preferences among large-scale participants	FUZZY OPTIMIZATION AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article; Early Access						Decision analysis; Graph model; Conflict resolution; Linguistic preferences; Large-scale participants	LINGUISTIC TERM SETS; FUZZY PREFERENCES	As a flexible and powerful method to resolve strategy conflicts, the graph model for conflict resolution has drawn much attention. In the graph model for conflict resolution, decision-makers need to provide their preference information for all possible scenarios. Most existing studies assumed that decision-makers adopt quantitative representation formats. However, in some real-life situations, decision-makers may tend to use qualitative assessments due to their cognitive expression habits. In addition, stakeholders involved in a graph model can be a group that is composed of a large number of participants. How to manage these participants' inconsistent preference assessments is also a debatable issue. To fit these gaps, in this study, we propose a graph model for conflict resolution with linguistic preferences, and this model allows participants to use inconsistent assessments. To do this, we first construct a linguistic preference structure, with the necessary concepts being defined. Then, four stability definitions for both a two-decision-maker scenario and an n-decision-maker scenario are introduced. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model, an illustrative example regarding the Huawei conflict is provided.

But the rampant urbanization and demand for the development of mass-transit infrastructure have put pressure on natural environment and heritage scape. Collaborative urban planning is essential especially in culturally and archaeologically rich cities. Megaprojects such as mass-transit systems, especially in developing countries, normally are encouraged for political point scoring. But the choices of the mod of mass-transit systems, their route selection, design and vertical alignment may have a devastating impact on cultural and historical heritage leading to serious conflicts during execution of mass-transit plans. This study employs system engineering decision analysis techniques to resolve urban planning issues of heritage sustainability while analysing metro-heritage conflict in Lahore. Realizing the fact that the attitude(s) of the Decision Makers (DMs) play important role in the decision-decision making, the authors use the attitudes of the DMs based on options in Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) to resolve the metro-heritage conflict.

The NRP conflict has been under way since 2012 and is investigated with respect to its current status in 2016. The dispute is modelled as follows: four decision makers (NRP support, NRP opposition, Recife local government, and judicial authorities), two graph models, and the preferences of Recife local government are evaluated according to four criteria (economic, environmental, social, and political) by a multiple-criteria method, the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE). Results suggest that lack of planning and public participation are critical issues in this Brazilian urban project and that both could improve decision making and prevent conflicts. Finally, analyzing this urban project conflict strategically also provides a reliable diagnosis of the situation and may help decision makers in future decisions and furnish guidelines to improve urban planning.

Enhanced GMCR model for resolving conflicts in a transboundary wetland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						AHP; DEMATEL; Game theory; GMCR model; The Hawizeh/Hoor-Al-AzimWetland	HIERARCHICAL GRAPH MODEL; DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; FUZZY DEMATEL; GAME-THEORY; MANAGEMENT; RESOLUTION; ALLOCATION; PREFERENCE	This research proposes an enhanced Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) with application to an international wetland. The integrated model enhances GMCR using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods to extract the relative preferences of decision-makers in conflict resolution. The Hawizeh/Hoor-Al-Azim Wetland is facing increased dust storms in recent decades which are attributed to drying up of Mesopotamian wetlands, creating the potential for conflicts among riparian countries. The proposed integrated approach was applied in the Hawizeh/Hoor-Al-Azim Wetland fed by the Tigris and Karkheh Rivers. Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria are located in the Tigris River basin, and the Karkheh River originates from the Zagros Mountains in western Iran. The results indicate that the achievement of an environmental balance depends on cooperation between Iran and Iraq to persuade Turkey to release the environmental flow to the wetland. Three strong equilibrium points were identified among 15 feasible states: (a) establishing a regional agreement among Iran, Iraq, and Turkey to reduce the effects of conflicts in the Hawizeh/Hoor-Al-Azim Wetland; (b) coalition of Iran and Iraq to motivate Turkey to reduce water withdrawal from the Tigris River; and finally, (c) exchanging water release for commodity market in Iran and Iraq for Turkey. In general, the economic cooperation among countries can be used as a negotiation tool to solve water conflicts in international wetlands. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, NN; Xu, YJ; Xu, LZ; Wang, HM				Wu, Nannan; Xu, Yejun; Xu, Lizhong; Wang, Huimin			The graph model for conflict resolution with consensus fuzzy preferences and its application to environmental sustainable development	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Graph model for conflict resolution; consensus; fuzzy preferences; sustainable development	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; DISPUTE	Conflict of environmental sustainable development as a common phenomenon can be seen everywhere in life. To capture consensus problems of decision makers (DMs) in conflict, a consensus and non-consensus fuzzy preference relation (FPR) matrix is proposed to the framework of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR). Concentrating on the case of two DMs within GMCR paradigm, four standard fuzzy solution concepts are developed into eight fuzzy stability definitions which can fully represent DMs' behavior characteristics of win-win and self-interested. To demonstrate how the novel GMCR methodology proposed in this paper can be conveniently utilized in practice, it is then applied to an environmental sustainable development conflict with two DMs. The results show that the general fuzzy equilibrium solutions are the intersection of consensus fuzzy equilibrium and non-consensus fuzzy equilibrium. Therefore, the GMCR technique considering DMs' consensus can effectively predict the various possible solutions of conflict development under different DMs' behavior preferences and provide new insights for analysts into a conflict.

Our motivation to present this proposal lies on the fact that unlike the original definition of generalized metarationality for n-DMs, our definition coincides with the definition of generalized metarationality for conflicts involving only two DMs. Moreover, our definition also includes the symmetric metarational stability as a particular case. We also establish some properties satisfied by the proposed alternative definition.

More specifically, an MCDA approach based on the outranking method, ELECTRE III, is employed for ranking states or possible scenarios in the conflict from most to least preferred, where ties are allowed, for a decision maker according to his or her value system. To demonstrate how this preference elicitation methodology can be conveniently implemented in practice within the framework of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution, it is applied to a real world water supply crisis which occurred in the town of North Battleford, located in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan.

J	Wu, NN; Xu, YJ; hipel, keith william				Wu, Nannan; Xu, Yejun; hipel, keith william			The graph model for conflict resolution with incomplete fuzzy reciprocal preference relations	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Incomplete fuzzy reciprocal preferences relations; The graph model for conflict resolution; Stability definitions; Water export conflict	DECISION-MAKING MODEL; CONSISTENCY; UNCERTAINTY; PRIORITY	Within the paradigm of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR), fuzzy reciprocal preference relations (FPRs) can be usually employed to handle decision makers' (DMs') certain and uncertain preferences. Due to lack of time, limited expertise, or dynamic factors, the DMs' fuzzy preferences over the alternatives or states may be incomplete. Thus, a new preference relation, the incomplete fuzzy reciprocal preference relation (IFPR), is proposed to deal with both complete and incomplete fuzzy preferences within GMCR. In this study, one key contribution is that, according to DMs' attitude to risk associated with incomplete fuzzy preferences, four extended sets of stability definitions are put forward for providing a nuanced description of human behavior for both two-DM and n-DM conflict models. Furthermore, the interrelationships of solution concepts within and across the four extensions of stability definitions are investigated. Finally, an illustrative example, the potential large-scale export of water from Lake Gisborne, Canada, is used to show the usefulness of GMCR with incomplete fuzzy reciprocal preference relations.

J	Andik, B; Niksokhan, MH				Andik, Behnam; Niksokhan, Mohammad Hossein			Waste load allocation under uncertainty using game theory approach and simulation-optimization process	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS			English	Article						graph model for conflict resolution; PAWN; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis; waste load allocation	CONFLICT-RESOLUTION; RISK-ASSESSMENT; GRAPH MODEL; GENETIC ALGORITHM; WATER; RIVER; SENSITIVITY; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; INFORMATION	This article aims to present a new methodology for waste load allocation (WLA) in a riverine system considering the uncertainty and achieve the lowest amount of inequity index, cost, and fuzzy risk of standard violation. To find a surface of undominated solutions, a new modified PAWN method, initially designed for sensitivity analysis, was developed and coupled with a simulation-optimization process using multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, to consider the uncertainty of all affecting variables and parameters by using their probability distribution. The proposed methodology applied to Sefidrood River in the northern part of Iran. Graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR) as a subset of game theory was implemented to attain a compromise on WLA among the stakeholders of a river system's quality in Iran: Department of Environment, Municipal Waste Water, and Private Sector. Some undominated solutions were used in GMCR model and modeling the conflict among decision makers reveals that their preferences and the status quo do not lead to a solely stable equilibrium; thus the intervention of a ruler as arbitrator leads them to reach a compromise on a scenario that has a median FRVS and cost. Sensitivity analysis was done using the PAWN method to assess the sensitivity of three intended objectives to all variables and parameters.

For that we propose the use of the maximin decision rule within the GMCR. More specifically, we consider a GMCR with two DMs and introduce the concept of Maximin(h) stability with horizon h for a given DM. The Maximin(h) stability concept was inspired by the notion of limited-move stability with horizon h present in the GMCR literature and it is adequate for modeling cautious DMs in conflicts where they have no knowledge about the other DM's preferences. We establish what is the relationship among the Maximin(h) stabilities for different horizons and the relationship among Maximin(h) stability and other GMCR stability concepts. Finally, we present an application to illustrate the proposed stability concept, namely, a neuroscience technological selection conflict in China.

We present new relations of this concept with existing stability definitions in the GMCR, namely: Nash stability, general metarational stability, symmetric metarational stability, sequential stability, limited-move stability of horizon 3 and credible metarational stable states of 2 rounds. We also present the SSEQ stability definition for a coalition and its relationship with existing solution concepts in that case. Finally, SSEQ stability is extended for GMCR with uncertain, probabilistic and fuzzy preferences.

Marc			Grey-Based Preference in a Graph Model for Conflict Resolution With Multiple Decision Makers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS			English	Article						Decision analysis; general grey numbers; graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR); sustainable development; uncertain preference	SUPPORT-SYSTEM; UNCERTAINTY; INFORMATION; OPTIMISM; SETS; MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; PESSIMISM; NUMBERS	To capture uncertainty in preferences, definitions based on grey numbers are incorporated into the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR), a realistic and flexible methodology to model and analyze strategic conflicts. A general grey number is a real number that may be a member of a discrete set of real numbers, or may fall within one or several intervals. It can represent uncertain preference of decision makers in a meaningful way. Here, a grey-based preference structure is developed and integrated with GMCR. Utilizing a number of grey-based ideas, solution concepts describing human behavior under conflict in the face of uncertain preference are defined for a conflict model. This grey-based GMCR is then applied to a generic sustainable development conflict with uncertain preferences in order to demonstrate how it can be conveniently utilized in practice.

Specifically, the parallel nature of attitudes and preferences is illuminated to show how attitudes can provide a simple way to more effectively represent complex preference structures when decision makers hold concern for other decision makers' interests.

J	Xu, HY; Zhao, JS; Ke, GY; Ali, S				Xu, Haiyan; Zhao, Jinshuai; Ke, Ginger Y.; Ali, Sharafat			Matrix representation of consensus and dissent stabilities in the graph model for conflict resolution	DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Consensus stability; Dissent stability; Matrix representation; Graph model; Conflict analysis	PREFERENCE; ATTITUDES; STRENGTH	The matrix representations of consensus or dissent stabilities for two decision makers are developed under the framework of the graph model for conflict resolution. This explicit algebraic form can be more effectively and conveniently employed to calculate consensus or dissent stabilities and predict equilibria of a graph model, while also facilitating modifications and new extensions. More specifically, this paper presents and proves the matrix definitions of eight stabilities considering the consensual and dissensual behaviors of decision makers. Then these stability concepts within the consensus and dissent preference are embedded into the latest version of decision support system NUAAGMCR, which can be used to study real-world conflicts. Through an illustrative case study, the procedure of applying the proposed algebraic method for calculating stability concepts in regard to consensus and dissent preferences is demonstrated, and valuable strategic insights are provided for a better understanding of the decision makers' behaviors.

J	Guedes, MJF; Ribeiro, MMR				Felipe Guedes, Maria Josicleide; Rios Ribeiro, Marcia Maria			Application of methodologies of environmental conflict analysis in Puxinana (PB) landfill	ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL			Portuguese	Article						final disposal of solid waste; environmental conflicts; decision support tools		The final disposal of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) landfill is discussed in this article in the context of environmental conflicts. From this perspective, the environmental conflict was analysed under the Puxinana Landfill (ASP), in Paraiba, in the period from July 2009 to August 2014. Techniques were addressed and implemented, and they contributed to the analysis and understanding of environmental conflict in question, at the macro level, assisting with necessary information for decision making. The location of the ASP within hydrographic basin of the main spring that supplies the entire urban population of the municipality of Puxinana (PB), plus the disposal of MSW of Campina Grande (PB) municipality in this landfill, aggravated the conflict. Through modeling the conflict using the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR), some alternative solutions were identified according to the players involved and the interests of each part. In the three simulated scenarios, the construction of a new landfill for Puxinana, as well as disposal of MSW Campina Grande in the landfill, was identified as an equilibrium for the conflict.

As a foundation, coalition motivation and real-coalition analysis are discussed when external circumstance or opportunity costs are considering. On the basis of a confidence-level function, we establish the score function using a preference tree. We not only measure the preference for each state, but we also build a collation improvement function to measure coalition motivation and to construct a coordinate system in which to analyze real-coalition stability. All of these developments enhance the applicability of the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR). Finally, an improved GMCR is applied in the Changzhou Conflict to demonstrate how it can be conveniently utilized in practice.

This comprehensive approach enables one to model a conflict situation involving misperception: held by and about the focal DM and its opponents. To achieve this, DMs' options in a conflict situation are classified based on different kinds of misperception that can alter the choices of the focal DM and/or the other DMs. Furthermore, the combination of DMs' options can generate the universal set of options for the entire conflict, which can then be used to construct the universal set of states. This novel design can differentiate between the states that are recognized by all DMs and those that are recognized individually. Furthermore, eight sets of equilibria are formally defined within the construction of the first-level hypergame in graph form to provide strategic insights into the conflict and reflect the effect of DMs' misperceptions on the equilibria of the dispute.

J	Xu, HY; Han, Y; Ke, GY; Zhu, J				Xu, Haiyan; Han, Yu; Ke, Ginger Y.; Zhu, Jun			Modeling and Implementation of a New Negotiation Decision Support System for Conflict Resolution Under Uncertainty	GROUP DECISION AND NEGOTIATION			English	Article; Early Access						Negotiation decision support system; Graph model for conflict resolution; Option prioritizing; Uncertain preference	GRAPH MODEL; PREFERENCE	The dynamic nature of negotiation and decision-making necessitates a flexible negotiation decision support system (NDSS) that can systematically investigate real-world strategic conflicts with a wide range of preference information with uncertainty. However, most of the existing decision support system, such as GMCR II under the framework of the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR), is only capable of handling simple preference. This research develops a new NDSS based on an algebraic representation to implement modeling and analysis for GMCR. More specifically, an algebraic approach using option prioritizing to generate unknown preference is proposed and then implemented to build an efficient and flexible modeling and analysis system. This new system may provide decision makers with valuable strategic insights for negotiations and decisions, especially in dynamic conflict environments.

The methodology identifies the preferences of the main stakeholders involved, along with all the environmental, political, technical and economic criteria that need to be considered in privatisation decisions. A DSS is then developed and tested on a case study involving the privatisation of a wastewater project. The system provides decision support through three steps: (1) screening of infeasible decisions using the elimination method of multiple criteria decision analysis; (2) determining the most stable decision by analysing the actions and counteractions of the stakeholders using conflict resolution and stability analysis; and (3) evaluating the robustness of decisions under varying levels of uncertainty using information gap theory. The DSS is useful for practitioners involved in infrastructure privatisation decisions for a variety of infrastructure systems such as transportation, water and energy.

The Strategy of Third-Party Mediation Based on the Option Prioritization in the Graph Model	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Graph Model for Conflict Resolution; third party; mediation; option prioritization; minimal adjustment	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; CONFLICT; INTERVENTION; RESOLUTION	The resolution of real-world conflicts is often supported by third-party intervention (i.e., mediation). This paper proposes a possible mediation support in the form of a reverse optimization procedure under the framework of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR). The approach computes minimal priority adjustments of preference statements that are necessary to achieve a desired agreement. A mathematical model, based on the matrix form of GMCR, is developed to analyze this third-party mediation problem. Thereby, this study makes a first attempt to obtain option-based mediation strategies, which add comprehensiveness to the traditional state-based strategies, yet are easier to understand and hence more acceptable to the conflict participants. To illustrate the practicality, the proposed procedure is applied to a medical dispute between a patient and a hospital, with the aim to suggest changes in the ordering of preference statements that lead to a desired outcome.

A graph model represents the interaction of two or more DMs and can be analyzed to identify possible equilibrium states according to each solution concept. Previously, solution concepts were defined logically, in terms of the underlying graphs. However, procedures to identify stable states based on these definitions are difficult to code because of the nature of the logical representations. In this paper, a graph model and four graph model solution concepts are formulated explicitly using matrices. More specifically, matrix expressions are given for relative preferences, joint unilateral movements, and joint unilateral improvements in a multiple-DM model. Then, it is shown how to calculate stability under each of the four solution concepts using the matrix representation. Compared with the existing approach, matrix representation is more effective and convenient for calculating stabilities and predicting equilibria of a graph model. In particular, the proposed method is easy to code and extend to other contexts.

More specifically, relational definitions for preferences, movements and stability concepts are defined for describing the attitudes and associated behavior of decision makers involved in a conflict. To capture misperceptions of decision makers in the War of 1812, attitudes are studied within the structure of a hypergame. Combining attitudes and misperceptions within the paradigm of the graph model furnishes the flexible analytical tool which demonstrates that misunderstanding of attitudes by Great Britain and the United States may have contributed to the outbreak of this nasty war.

Recognizing the economic potential of the area, the industry has requested additional farming opportunities. However, Baynes Sound upland residents and many other stakeholders have expressed concerns that SAI activities are having a negative impact on the environment, quality of life, and other nonacuaculture resource uses in the area. In order to address these issues, the Action Plan was initiated by a BC government interagency project team in November 2001. To assist in assessing the strategic aspects of this conflict, the decision support system GMCR II is employed here to apply a new methodology, the graph model for conflict resolution, to systematically analyze the ongoing conflict over shellfish aquaculture development in Baynes Sound within a social, economic, and environmental framework. Valuable insights are procured to guide decision-makers toward sustainability of the shellfish industry.

J	Silva, MM; Poleto, T; de Gusmao, APH; Costa, APCS				Silva, Maisa Mendonca; Poleto, Thiago; de Gusmao, Ana Paula Henriques; Costa, Ana Paula Cabral Seixas			A strategic conflict analysis in IT outsourcing using the graph model for conflict resolution	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						IT outsourcing; Strategic conflict analysis; Graph model for conflict resolution	SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS; DECISION-MAKING APPROACH; RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; CONTRACTUAL GOVERNANCE; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; TRUST; MECHANISMS; MANAGEMENT	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose a strategic conflict analysis, based on the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR), that is applied to information technology outsourcing (ITO) in a real-world software development and implementation process in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach Because the idea of this study is to answer "why" the ITO conflicts occur and "how" they can be avoided, the case study methodology was adopted. The software GMCR II was used to analyze the interactions between an IT vendor and an IT client. Findings The results suggest that a lack of relational governance is a critical issue that could be handled to improve the interaction between those involved. Research limitations/implications The main results are restricted to the case study and cannot be generalized. Moreover, a specific limitation of this paper pertains to the use of the GMCR and the consequent difficulty for IT vendors and IT clients to work with a large number of actions and to set preferences for several states of conflict. Practical implications The strategic analysis of outsourcing conflicts provides a holistic view of the current situation that may assist the client and vendor in future decisions and identify guidelines to ensure successful ITO. Therefore, this paper provides an effective guide for clients and vendors to better manage conflicts and establish a contingency vision to avoid such disputes. Originality/value The ITO conflict is analyzed using the GMCR, considering both perspectives of the outsourcing process (vendors and clients).

By modelling the conflict for the situation existing as of July 2005, just before the project began operation, the dispute is put into proper perspective and, subsequently, a stability analysis is carried out to obtain potential resolutions or equilibria. The results of a sensitivity analysis accurately predict the deal which actually took place when Canada and the American state of North Dakota reached a negotiated settlement. Finally, suggestions are put forward for improving the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 between Canada and the United States. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One such conflict which arose from the redevelopment of a private brownfield property in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada is examined using such a decision support tool. Specifically, a formal model referred to as COAT which allows for the examination of conflicts with both coalition and attitude properties is rigorously defined and then implemented within the framework of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution in order that insights may be gained on how the decision makers can reach win-win resolutions.

More particularly, the forward GMCR is utilized in Stage I, the negotiation stage, to simulate the evolution of a Brownfield Conflict (BC) and predict its potential resolution via stability analysis. If no acceptable equilibrium can be obtained, the BC progresses into Stage II, the third-party-intervention stage, where the inverse GMCR is used to assist a third party in intervening the conflict to achieve a desirable outcome. To illustrate the practicality of this framework, a recent BC that occurred in Changzhou, China, is taken as a case study. Invaluable insights are provided through the computation and investigation of the corresponding preference relationships.

J	Sharma, A; hipel, keith william; Schweizer, V				Sharma, Ajar; hipel, keith william; Schweizer, Vanessa			Strategic Insights into the Cauvery River Dispute in India	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Conflict Resolution; Graph Model; fuzzy preference; option prioritization; Water Resources; GMCR	GRAPH MODEL	For hundreds of years, conflicts in water sharing have existed all around the globe. Cauvery River, in the southern part of India, has been in the midst of such conflict for the last 130 years. Historically, the conflict has been about the right to use water and the states/provinces in conflict have used the water from the river for agricultural purposes. Due to industrialization in the late 1980s and increasing population, water availability in the region has become stressed. Climate change has exacerbated the region's water availability issues. Faltering rainfall has caused unrest in the region, and the traditional methods of water sharing are dwindling under political pressure. Without a climate change strategy, the governments of these states will never be able to solve this complex issue at hand. The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) is applied to understand the nuances of this conflict. It models the preferences of the decision-makers (the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka) and the common option (goal) they can reach to potentially solve the conflict. Fuzzy preferences along with option prioritization is also applied to this conflict in order to account for the uncertainties in the decision-makers' preferences. The purpose of this paper is to nudge decision-makers in a productive direction to overcome the long-impending political standoff, while introducing a new methodology of looking into this old conflict.

Marc; hipel, keith william			Strength of preference in graph models for multiple-decision-maker conflicts	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article							SUPPORT-SYSTEM; UNCERTAINTY; RESOLUTION	Models of strength of preference are incorporated into the graph model for conflict resolution to study realistically multi-objective decision making situations in disputes with any finite number of participants. A decision maker's preference is expressed using a triplet of binary relations that allows preference of one state over another to be strong or weak, and also allows indifference. Four basic stability definitions used in the graph model to represent human behavior in conflicts are extended to the context of the new triplet preference structure, producing strong and weak stabilities. Theorems governing the relationships among standard, strong, and weak stabilities are presented. Finally, application of the new preference representation to an international water resource management conflict confirms the practical utility of the triplet structure and the significance of the strategic insights it can provide.

This weighted hierarchical model contains three decision makers (DMs), one common decision maker (CDM) appearing in two local graphs, each with one local decision maker. Reachable lists and unilateral improvements for DMs are represented by matrices, which can be used to calculate stability results. Theorems reveal the relationship between the stability results in the hierarchical graph and in each local graph. Algorithms are designed to capitalize on these relationships in the calculation of stability. A case study of water diversion conflicts in China is provided to show how the new methodology can be applied in practice. The weighted hierarchical graph model improves the modeling of hierarchical conflicts by providing more flexibility in describing the preference of the CDM, who is the key decision-maker.

In a new definition of power asymmetry, one of the decision makers (DMs) in a conflict can influence the preferences of other DMs by taking advantage of additional options reflecting the particular DM's more powerful position. The more powerful DM may have three different kinds of power: direct positive, direct negative, or indirect. It is useful to analyze a model of a conflict without power asymmetry, and then to analyze a power-asymmetric model. As demonstrated by analysis of the water quality controversy that took place at the border separating the Chinese provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, this novel conflict resolution methodology can be readily applied to real-world strategic conflicts to gain an enhanced understanding of the effects of asymmetric power.

This technique uses the DM's fuzzy relative importance of its preference statements and their fuzzy truth values for the feasible states in a conflict under uncertain conditions. A preference statement of a DM is a preferable combination of DM's options or courses of action. The fuzzy importance for one preference statement over another, a value in the interval [0, 1], is interpreted as the degree to which the first preference statement is more important than the second to the DM. A fuzzy truth value of a preference statement at a feasible state is a number in the interval [0, 1] that represents the degree to which the statement is true at the state. When the DM is confident in its pairwise fuzzy importance degrees over the preference statements and their fuzzy truth values at the feasible states, the methodology provides a fuzzy preference over the states. When there is an ordinary or crisp importance ordering of preference statements and when the truth values of preference statements are classical or crisp at the feasible states, the technique generates a crisp preference over the states. The methodology is illustrated using a case study.	[Bashar, M. Abul] Univ Jeddah, Dept Ind Engn, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Bashar, M. Abul; Obeidi, Amer; Kilgour, D.

Marc; Fang, Liping			Fuzzy levels of preference strength in a graph model with multiple decision makers	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Decision analysis; Graph model for conflict resolution; Multiple levels of preference; Fuzzy preference; Stability definitions	CONFLICT-RESOLUTION; OPTION PRIORITIZATION; TRANSITIVITY; DISPUTE; SYSTEMS	A new hybrid preference structure combining multiple-level strength of preference and fuzzy preference is proposed to facilitate the modeling and analysis of strategic conflicts involving multiple decision makers (DMs) with complex preferences using the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR). The new preference structure, named fuzzy strength of preference, provides a more comprehensive and flexible representation of DMs' relative preferences among states. A key contribution of this paper is to redefine four graph model stability definitions for fuzzy preferences, fuzzy Nash stability (FNash), fuzzy general metarationality (FGMR), fuzzy symmetric metarationality (FSMR), and fuzzy sequential stability (FSEQ), as general stabilities, strong stabilities, and weak stabilities at each level, permitting deeper analysis of graph models with the new preference structure. The resulting methodology can be utilized to model and analyze complex multiple-DM conflicts, thereby enhancing the capability of the graph model to provide strategic insights. A graph model of the Zhanghe River water allocation conflict in China demonstrates that the method can find the evolution path of a conflict and give new strategic insights for both practitioners and researchers. The fuzzy strength of preference framework makes GMCR more capable for addressing a wider range of practical conflicts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Unlike previous methods to deal with uncertainty in a graph model, the new approach incorporates a compromise solution that reflects subjective and objective criteria, as well as uncertainty. The main advantages of this approach are (1) it makes preference evaluations comparable, even if they are based on entirely different scales; (2) it offers probabilistic combinations of evaluations according to multiple criteria without requiring criterion weighting; and (3) assessing preferences requires less effort from decision makers. An actual conflict regarding the development of an urban project in the city of Recife, Brazil, is presented to illustrate the application of the new methodology. According to the experts involved in the analysis, the equilibrium results provided by the method are coherent and may help all decison makers in future interactions.

J	Tao, LY; Su, XB; Javed, SA				Tao, Liangyan; Su, Xuebi; Javed, Saad Ahmed			Inverse Preference Optimization in the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution based on the Genetic Algorithm	GROUP DECISION AND NEGOTIATION			English	Article						Group decision and negotiation; Inverse GMCR; Preference optimization; Conflict Resolution; Genetic Algorithm; Graph Model for Conflict Resolution	STRATEGIC ANALYSIS; DECISION-SUPPORT; NEGOTIATION; MANAGEMENT; PROJECT	The Inverse GMCR (Graph Model for Conflict Resolution) produces rankings of possible states (preference relation profiles) that will make the desired resolution of a conflict stable. However, there are usually numerous preference relation profiles making it difficult for a third party to choose an appropriate preference relation to design its mediation strategy. Moreover, the cost or effort of changing preference relations over states has rarely been studied in Inverse GMCR. The current study presents two inverse preference optimization models considering the cost and effort in changing preferences to address these issues. The first model aims to ascertain an optimal preference at minimum adjustment cost such that the desired equilibrium is reached. The other model is to find an optimal required preference under minimum adjustment amount, which is defined as the difference between the required preference matrix and the original preference matrix. Then, a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based algorithm is proposed. Finally, the two proposed preference optimization methods are applied to two cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

This technique models and analyses DMs' different levels of perception in a real-life situation. It also handles a DM's misperception about itself as well as misperception about its opponents. A hypergame in graph form is a framework that consists of subjective hypergames, each of which illustrates a given DM's viewpoint of the hypergame situation. The universal sets of options and states for the hypergame, which include all possible perceptual options and states for the conflict, are used to construct each DM's subjective hypergame. To gain worthy strategic insights from the hypergame analysis, the overall hypergame equilibria are classified based on the types of misperceptions and the awareness of DMs into eight classes of resolutions.

Minimization of total treatment and penalty costs and minimization of biological oxygen demand violation of standards at the check point are considered as the main objectives of this study. At first, the water quality along the river was simulated using the Streeter-Phelps (S-P) equation coupled with the MOPSO model. Thereby a trade-off curve between the objectives is obtained and a set of non-dominated solutions is selected. In the next step, the best alternative is chosen using MCDM techniques and the GMCRII DSS package and non-cooperative stability definitions. The applicability and efficiency of the methodology are examined in a real-world case study of the Sefidrud River in the northern part of Iran.

Model formulation is presented in Part I, and analysis and output interpretation in Part II. GMCR II is based upon existing and new research developments of the graph model for conflict resolution. In Part I, specially designed data structures and corresponding algorithms are implemented for generating and representing possible states, removing infeasible states, coalescing indistinguishable states, and specifying and storing allowable state transitions. Algorithms implementing different approaches to the elicitation of preferences over states enable GMCR II to construct and manage an efficient, flexible, and complete graph model of a strategic conflict.

The proposed negotiation methodology has a unique ability to consider the attitudes of the decision makers, which is an important psychological factor in the negotiations that take place in various stages of a construction project. The methodology is developed at the strategic level of decision making in which the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR) is employed in assisting decision makers, such as project managers, to achieve the best strategic decision, given the competing interests and attitudes of the decision makers. A real-life case study is used to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be conveniently applied in practice and to demonstrate the importance and the benefits of incorporating the attitudes of multiple decision makers into the negotiation process in order to better identify the most feasible resolutions. The proposed negotiation methodology has been implemented in a negotiation decision support system that assists project managers in tackling real-world controversies, particularly in complex disputes that occur in construction projects.

The decision support system GMCR II, which permits the graph model methodology to be conveniently implemented in practice, is used to model and analyze the strategic interaction of aquaculturists, environmental groups, First Nations, other stakeholders, and the provincial and federal governments. This study is timely because the controversial moratorium on the expansion of the salmon aquaculture industry was lifted recently, with the express purpose of fostering economic growth. Strategic insights gained from the graph model analyses demonstrate how difficult it will be to develop salmon aquaculture so as to balance multiple objectives including sustainability, shielding of the natural aquatic ecosystem, economic benefits, and social welfare for key stakeholders.

The algebraic approach establishes an integrated paradigm for stability analysis and status quo analysis under different preference structures, such as two-level preference and three-level preference. Difficulties in coding algorithms to analyze stabilities, rooted in their logical representation, led to the development of matrix representations of preference and explicit matrix calculations to determine stabilities. Here, the algebraic approach is used to represent graph models with three levels of preference and to conduct stability analysis for such models. The algebraic approach facilitates the development of new stability concepts and algorithms to calculate them, and reveals an inherent link between status quo analysis and traditional stability analysis. Hence, it will facilitate the design of an integrated decision support system for the graph model for conflict resolution. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Kilgour, D.

The truth value of option statements at a state in crisp option prioritization is based on Boolean logic, which is unable to handle some specific circumstances that the truth value may not be precisely "true" or "false". Therefore, the concept of grey interval truth value is proposed to capture the uncertainty in the truth of an option statement at a feasible state, which takes into account binary truth values as well as any truth uncertainties that are more general according to the specific conditions and can reflect some thoughtful consideration of Decision Makers (DMs). For obtaining DMs' grey preferences over feasible states, grey option prioritization technique is introduced by assigning an interval grey score to each state according to its interval grey truth values. And it is confirmed that grey option prioritization can also handle crisp truth values of option statements that are completely based on Boolean logic, making crisp option prioritization technique as a special case of grey option prioritization method Finally, this method is applied to Elmira groundwater contamination dispute to demonstrate how it can be employed to solve real-world decision problems.

J	Kato, Y				Kato, Yukiko			State transition for de-escalation in the graph model for conflict resolution framework	JSIAM LETTERS			English	Article						conflict resolution; graph model for conflict resolution; de-escalation		This study discusses the analysis method for obtaining solutions that allow de-escalation in international conflicts within the framework of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution. CD games, a conflict type in which two decision-makers can choose Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) strategies, are analyzed by examining the state transition and stability of decision makers with a focus on reachability. Based on the analysis, a new conceptual set is proposed, called 'de-escalation reachability,' which enables focused analysis on the conflict states while avoiding any influence of arbitrators' attributes.

J	Kassab, M; Hegazy, T; Hipel, K				Kassab, Moustafa; Hegazy, Tarek; hipel, keith william			Computerized DSS for Construction Conflict Resolution under Uncertainty	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction management; Decision support system; Conflict resolution; MCDA; Game theory; Information gap theory	GRAPH MODEL	Due to the inherent nature of construction projects, conflicts are unavoidable among the various parties involved. Such conflicts often delay projects and cause losses for all parties. This paper presents the development of a decision support system (DSS) to help in resolving construction disputes. The DSS integrates the elimination method to shortlist promising resolutions to a conflict, the graph model for conflict resolution to determine the best resolution that satisfies all decision makers' preferences, and the information gap theory to consider uncertain decision preferences. A prototype system has been developed and a case study of a construction conflict used to demonstrate its features. The presented methodology for construction conflict resolution is useful for both researchers and practitioners to better deal with the dispute-prone nature of the construction industry under uncertainty and lack of information. In this paper, the proposed prototype successfully simulated and predicted the sequence of decisions that took place in the case study dispute, in the presence of uncertainty.

In 1971, Hydro-Quebec, which is the third-largest electrical generating company of North America, began its large-scale hydroelectric projects in the James Bay area. Since the projects would significantly affect the living conditions of the native people and the environment around that region, worldwide debates were stimulated. A conflict model was developed in terms of the decision makers, their options, and their preferences for the situation existing as of January 2002, just prior to the signing of the final agreement. Subsequently, a stability analysis based on the calibrated model indicates that a possible resolution is that Hydro-Quebec reduces the number of proposed power stations to appease the native people, who in turn would not initiate lawsuits. Sensitivity and hypergame analyses were also carried out to demonstrate the effects of preferences of decision makers on the final resolution. In practice, the modelling and analysis were implemented using the decision support system, GMCR II (R).

More specifically, the newly defined coalition stability definitions that are considered are coalition Nash stability (CNash), coalition general metarationality (CGMR), coalition symmetric metarationality (CSMR) and coalition sequential stability (CSEQ), along with their earlier-defined noncooperative versions. A range of interesting new theorems are derived to establish connections among these coalition stability concepts as well as between noncooperative and coalition stability definitions. Applications with respect to the games of Prisoner's Dilemma and Chicken, as well as a groundwater contamination dispute, demonstrate how the various stability definitions can be applied in practice and confirm the validity of some of the theorems as well as point out, by example, certain types of relationships which cannot hold.

J	O'Brien, NL; hipel, keith william				O'Brien, Nicole L.; hipel, keith william			A strategic analysis of the New Brunswick, Canada fracking controversy	ENERGY ECONOMICS			English	Article						The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution; Hydraulic fracturing; New Brunswick, Canada; Elsipogtog First Nation	NATURAL-GAS; CONFLICT; PLAYS	Strategic insights into the previous conflict between the Elsipogtog First Nation and the New Brunswick (NB) Provincial Government are presented using a formal conflict resolution technique. The conflict surrounds the prospect of widespread hydraulic fracturing in NB, one of Canada's Maritime provinces on the east coast of the country. The hydraulic fracturing technique, used for mining natural gas trapped in shale rock formations, has recently received much attention. The process is strongly opposed by some groups, including the Elsipogtog First Nation, primarily due to the potential environmental impacts associated with the technique. Through the application of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution, it is found that the status quo at the time of the conflict was the most likely outcome in this conflict. The previous Conservative New Brunswick government had a great deal of power in this conflict and it had demonstrated its intention to develop the shale gas in the province in the face of much civil unrest. It is discovered, however, that there is a potential resolution to the conflict that will appease the residents of NB, if a moratorium is issued concerning hydraulic fracturing.

At that time, catches and landed values in the salmon fishery were near record levels and both countries viewed the agreement as a means of enhancing their individual prosperity. After a short period of co-operation, the 1985 treaty was undermined by arguments over catch sharing and the failure to rebuild some important salmon stocks. A revised treaty, agreed upon in 1999, established conservation of salmon as a priority and included a side-payment, in the form of two endowment funds designed in part to appease Canadian concern over catch imbalances. Major shifts in abundances combined with significant reductions in the value of the fishery were key factors in the negotiations. In this paper, we use the graph model for conflict resolution to examine the stability of the revised salmon treaty. Our assessment suggests that the treaty will be stable if the side-payment is maintained or enhanced even if both countries pursue aggressive fishing strategies. If the side-payment is not maintained, then it is likely that all groups will attempt to maximize their catch and Canada will seek a renegotiation of the treaty.

In this paper, we propose two option prioritizing techniques to obtain probabilistic preferences in the GMCR more efficiently. The crisp preference option prioritizing relies on an ordered sequence of preference statements that determines the crisp preference relation. In the first proposed technique, a probability distribution is associated with a class of ordered sequences of preference statements of the DM, where the probability of state s being preferred to state t by the DM consists of the sum of the probabilities of the ordered sequences of preference statements where s is preferred to t according to the crisp preference based on the corresponding ordered sequence of preference statements. In the second technique proposed, we allow for uncertainty both on the set of preference statements considered by a DM and also on which preference statement within the set is the most important one for him. An application is provided to illustrate the use of these techniques.

It is assumed that the coordinator has a priori prospect of feasible alternatives. First, the method of the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR) is extended to apply to this conflict with incomplete information, and the coordination system for the conflict with incomplete information is proposed. The process operated by the coordinator uses Extended Robustness Analysis that specifies the critical conditions for the stability and Pareto efficiency of an alternative. Finally, the methodology is applied to the conflict between hydropower generation and environmental interests.

More specifically, the ongoing toxic waste conflicts are divided into two stages consisting of the dumping prevention and dispute resolution stages. The modeling and analyses, based on the methodology of graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR), are used in both stages in order to grasp the structure and implications of a given conflict from a strategic viewpoint. Furthermore, a specific case study is investigated for the Ivory Coast hazardous waste conflict. In addition to the stability analysis, sensitivity and attitude analyses are conducted to capture various strategic features of this type of complicated dispute. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The ordinal preferences in GMCR are advantageous to carry out sensitivity analyses with respect to systematically identifying the influence of preference alterations upon the four basic stabilities consisting of Nash stability, general metarationality, symmetric metarationality and sequential stability. The proposed algebraic representation of the four basic stabilities is not only effective and convenient for computer implementation of sensitivity analysis, but also makes it easier to understand the meaning of the four stabilities when compared with the existing matrix representation. Further, these sensitivity analyses results are embedded into the latest version of the decision support system NUAAGMCR, which can be used to study real-world conflicts. To illustrate how these contributions to sensitivity analyses can be applied in practice and provide valuable strategic insights, they are used to investigate the civil war conflict in South Sudan.

The preferences of decision-makers are described by a scoring system. Equilibria under different solution concepts are calculated as the indication of possible outcomes or strategic resolutions for decision-makers. This novel methodology is applied to subsidy disputes between the national government in China and two provincial governments, typical hierarchical conflicts containing sequential moves of the national government who wishes to strategically allocate the limited subsidies to encourage the compliance of carbon mitigation policies by the provinces. In-depth analysis is carried out to determine the equilibria that can be evolved from the starting state, called the status quo. Among these equilibria, the most preferred one for the national government, called the optimal equilibrium, suggests meaningful resolutions for each decision-maker. In particular, the national government in China is advised to subsidize the more industrialized province so that both provinces would comply with its carbon mitigation policies.

In light of the failure of many nations to meet their expected Kyoto Protocol emission reduction targets and the lack of involvement of the world's greatest emitters of airborne pollutants, the USA and PRC, there is a need to determine successful strategies for combating climate change. The issues surrounding the potential implementation of a bilateral agreement between the USA and PRC are systematically analyzed. Information gathered about the decision makers, options and preferences within the potential negotiations is utilized to create a valid conflict model which is used as a basis for carrying out strategic analyses. Moreover, a novel method is implemented within the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution to gain insights into the impact of attitudes on these negotiations. The strategic findings reflect reasonably well what actually occurred in November 2014 when the USA and PRC negotiated a bilateral deal.

Construction and application of hyper-inverse conflict models based on the sequential stability	EURO JOURNAL ON DECISION PROCESSES			English	Article						Graph model for conflict resolution; Inverse problem; Hypergame; Sequential stability; Nonlinear binary programming model	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; GRAPH MODEL; STRATEGIC ANALYSIS; SUPPLY CHAIN; PREFERENCE; RESOLUTION	Based on the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR), an analytical framework is proposed to assist the focal decision maker (DM) with an informational advantage in resolving real-world hyper-inverse conflict situations considering the sequential (SEQ) stability. The hyper-inverse conflict resolution aims to obtain the opponent's misunderstanding preferences of focal DM, which can assist the focal DM in taking the initiative in a conflict. Among all stabilities in GMCR, the SEQ stability is selected in the present study, because this stability concept provides a logical basis for a DM to sanction the opponent, which reflects the case for many conflicts. Moreover, a nonlinear binary optimization model rooted in the matrix representation of SEQ stability is constructed to capture the cause and process of the abnormal individual stability (or stabilities) in the hypergame. Then, a solution procedure is designed for solving the optimization model to obtain the preferences that are misunderstood by the opponent.

These information-gap models are designed for handling a variety of situations for expressing severe preference-uncertainty of a decision maker, including both transitive and intransitive preferences among the states or possible scenarios in a conflict. Applications of these decision technologies to the game of chicken and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 illustrate how the information-gap models can be conveniently utilized in practice and how strategic insights can be gained through rigorous examination of the robustness of equilibrium solutions to uncertainty in preferences. It is also shown that uncertainty-analyses can lead to modification of a decision maker's prior preferences. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The preference statements of a DM express desirable combinations of options or courses of action, and are listed in order of importance. A fuzzy truth value is a truth degree, expressed as a number between 0 and 1, capturing uncertainty in the truth of a preference statement at a feasible state. A fuzzy preference formula is introduced based on the fuzzy truth values of preference statements, and it is established that the output of this formula is a fuzzy preference relation. It is shown that fuzzy option prioritization can also be used when the truth values of preference statements at feasible states are completely based on Boolean logic, thereby generating a crisp preference over feasible states that is the same as would be found by employing the existing crisp option prioritization, making the crisp option prioritization technique a special case of the fuzzy option prioritization methodology. To demonstrate how this methodology can be employed to represent fuzzy preferences in real-world decision problems, fuzzy option prioritization is applied to an actual dispute over groundwater contamination that took place in Elmira, Ontario, Canada.

J	Rego, LC; Silva, HV; Rodrigues, CD				Rego, Leandro Chaves; Silva, Hugo Victor; Rodrigues, Carlos Diego			Optimizing the cost of preference manipulation in the graph model for conflict resolution	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Conflict intervention; Inverse GMCR; Minimum cost; Computational complexity; Optimal incentives	3RD-PARTY	Conflicts occur when different parties have different evaluations regarding the resolution of some issue and each one of them can change the conflict scenario in more than one way. These conflicts may occur at various levels from the personal scale to conflicts involving large blocks of countries and various types of conflict costs might be involved, such as: economic, social and environmental. In many situations, offering incentives to alter the preferences of some decision makers (DMs) might be an effective way to achieve desirable stable scenarios. The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) is a model that has long been used to model and analyze conflicts because it is flexible and easy to calibrate. The purpose of this paper is to present ideas on how to work with the inverse GMCR to optimize costs in changing the preferences of each DM to achieve desired equilibrium states within the conflict. We propose some methods to aggregate costs of changing DMs' preferences. The purpose is to determine the lowest aggregate cost of preference changes that makes a given desired state an equilibrium according to a given stability notion. Besides formally describing the problem, we study some properties of the minimum costs for different stability notions and show that the computational complexity of the optimal preference manipulation problem is NP-hard. We apply this method to analyze the Cuban missile conflict. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Theory and application of conflict resolution with hybrid preference in colored graphs	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Conflict resolution; Matrix representation; Graph model; Hybrid preference; Decision maker	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; MODEL; MATRIX	An algebraic approach is proposed to calculate stabilities in a colored graph with hybrid preference. The algebraic approach establishes a hybrid framework for stability analysis by combining strength of preference and unknown preference. The hybrid system is more general than existing models, which consider preference strength and preference uncertainty separately. Within the hybrid preference structure, matrix representations of four basic stabilities in a colored graph are extended to include mild, strong, and uncertain preference and algorithms are developed to calculate efficiently the inputs essential to the stability definitions. A specific case study, including multiple decision makers and hybrid preference, is used to illustrate how the proposed method can be applied in practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This methodology, as implemented in the Decision Support System GMCR, constitutes a useful tool for negotiation support. Because GMCR includes efficient algorithms for calculating the stability of states, it encourages extensive comparisons of the consequences of different models of negotiators' decision making. GMCR also facilitates modifications to the way in which the conflict is represented, encouraging sensitivity and what-if analyses. The applicability of GMCR to negotiations is discussed in general, and in the context of a specific case study in environmental conflict resolution.

These concepts are useful to the analysis of interactions among DMs with altruistic behaviors. Berge behavior can be observed in conflicts where DMs act altruistically expecting others to reciprocate so that in the end it is in their own self-interests to behave in this way. The Berge stabilities presented are inspired on commonly used stability notions in the GMCR, such as: generalized metarationality, symmetric metarationality, sequential and symmetric sequential stabilities for conflicts with 2 or more DMs. We investigate the relation among these proposed concepts and also between such concepts and the standard ones. We also establish a relationship between Berge stability and coalition Nash stability of a modified conflict. The chicken and stag hunt games are used as examples to illustrate applications of the Berge stabilities in conflicts. In particular, we show that in the stag hunt game and in a modified version of it, Berge stabilities may be used to select a more desired Nash equilibria.

A classification of these solution concepts, also called stability definitions, is presented both to simplify understanding and to illustrate important differences among different stability regimes. The relationships among solution concepts are explored and new, more specific results are obtained in the comparison among existing stability concepts and the newly proposed ones.

By constructing a sound theoretical foundation for GMCR based upon assumptions reflecting what actually occurs in reality, a fascinating story is narrated on how GMCR was able to expand in bold new directions as well as take advantage of many important legacy decision technologies built within the earlier Metagame Analysis and later Conflict Analysis paradigms. From its predecessors, for instance, GMCR could benefit by the employment of option form put forward within Metagame Analysis for effectively recording a conflict, as well as preference elicitation techniques and solution concepts for defining chess-like behavior when calculating stability of states from the realm of Conflict Analysis. The key ideas outlined in the paper underlying the current and projected capabilities of GMCR include the development of four different ways to handle preference uncertainty in the presence of either transitive or intransitive preferences; a wide range of solution concepts for describing many kinds of human behavior under conflict; unique coalition analysis algorithms for determining if a given decision maker can fare better in a dispute via cooperation; tracing the evolution of a conflict over time; and the matrix formulation of GMCR for computational efficiency when calculating stability and also theoretically expanding GMCR in bold new directions. Inverse engineering is mentioned as an AI extension of GMCR for computationally determining the preferences required by decision makers in order to reach a desirable state, such as a climate change agreement in which all nations significantly cut back on their greenhouse gas emissions. The basic design of a decision support system for permitting researchers and practitioners to readily apply the foregoing and other advancements in GMCR to tough real world controversies is discussed. Although GMCR has been successfully applied to challenging disputes arising in many different fields, a simple climate change negotiation conflict between the US and China is utilized to explain clearly key concepts mentioned throughout the fascinating historical journey surrounding GMCR.

These novel stability concepts address both risk-averse and risk-seeking decision-makers by comparing the consequences of moving from a given starting state to those of remaining in that state.

A new definition of stability for a DM that depends on the total number, h, of moves and counter-moves allowed is proposed. Moreover, the metarational tree can be refined so that all moves must be unilateral improvements, resulting in a new set of stability definitions for each level of the tree. Relationships among stabilities at various levels of the basic and refined trees are explored, and connections are established to existing stability definitions including Nash stability, general metarationality, symmetric metarationality, sequential and limited-move stability, and policy equilibria.

This flexible conflict resolution methodology has solid and realistic mathematical foundations which permit it to model strategic decisions accurately, forecast compromise solutions, and assist in assessing the political, economic, environmental, and social viability of alternative scenarios to resolving environmental conflicts. To permit practitioners to conveniently apply the graph model for conflict resolution to practical real-world conflict problems, a ne iv decision support system called GMCR II (Graph Model for Conflict Resolution II) is designed. To explain the basic structure of GMCR II and how it works in practice, this paper describes its use to model and analyze an international environmental management dispute that took place in North America.

The objective is to identify favorable outcome(s) in a multiple participant-multiple objective decision problem with fuzzy preference information. More specifically, coalition versions of fuzzy Nash stability, fuzzy general metarationality, fuzzy symmetric metarationality, and fuzzy sequential stability are proposed. They constitute a natural generalization of the corresponding non-cooperative fuzzy preference-based definitions for Nash stability, general metarationality, symmetric metarationality, and sequential stability, respectively. Coalition fuzzy stability definitions are employed to analyze an actual dispute over groundwater contamination in Elmira, Ontario, Canada, demonstrating how these new concepts can be conveniently applied to practical problems in order to gain valuable strategic insights.

More specifically, the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution is employed to formally model and analyze this conflict using the decision support system called GMCR+. The conflict analysis findings indicate that the dispute is enduring because of a lack of incentive and opportunity for any party to move beyond the present circumstances. Continued negotiations are not likely to resolve this conflict. A substantial change in the preferences or options of the disputants, or new governance tools will be required to move this conflict forward. This may hold lessons for future groundwater conflicts. It is, however, increasingly likely that the parties will require a third party intervention, such as equal apportionment by the US Supreme Court. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The matrix representations are furnished for the relative preferences, unilateral movements and improvements, as well as joint movements and joint improvements for a conflict having two or more decision makers. Theoretical conditions are derived for specifying required preference relationships in an inverse graph model. Under each of the four solution concepts, a matrix relationship is established to obtain all the available preferences for each decision maker causing the specific state to be an equilibrium. To explain how it can be employed in practice, this new approach to inverse analysis is applied to the Elsipogtog First Nation fracking dispute which took place in the Canadian Province of New Brunswick.

At the strategic level, the proposed methodology employs the graph model for conflict resolution and helps negotiators find the most beneficial subset of solutions to the conflict. At the tactical level, the proposed methodology examines the most beneficial strategic decisions using utility functions to provide agreed-upon tradeoffs with respect to any conflicting issues. A construction case study is used to illustrate the proposed methodology and demonstrate the importance of incorporating decision makers' attitudes into negotiation to better identify the most feasible decisions. The proposed methodology may assist negotiators with the challenges of conventional negotiation through the incorporation of decision makers' attitudes into a range of analytical tools that will clarify interests, determine equilibrium outcomes, identify tradeoffs, recognize negotiators' satisfaction, and generate optimum solutions.

Marc			Strategic analysis of the Great Canadian Hydroelectric Power Conflict	ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS			English	Article						Hydroelectric power; Energy; Conflict; Negotiations; Equilibrium analysis; The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution		The contract negotiation that led to the 1969 agreement between Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec, is systemically analyzed within the framework of Graph Model for Conflict Resolution. The Great Canadian Hydroelectric Power Conflict has been ongoing since 1963 and shows no signs of ending. In this dispute, the Province of Quebec has the right to buy almost all of the power generated from the Upper Churchill Falls, which is located in the Labrador territory in Newfoundland and Labrador, at a very low price. Originally, the contract was signed by Churchill Falls Labrador Corporation to secure finances for the Upper Churchill Falls development. The unpopularity of the contract led to several unsuccessful attempts by the Newfoundland and Labrador Government to escape its provisions. Newfoundland and Labrador is currently negotiating to develop the Lower Churchill Project and seeking to avoid the mistakes of the first contract. Furthermore, the automatic renewal clause of the original contract is expected to cause another round of conflict in 2016. The analysis shows that, given the circumstances in which the agreement was signed, the outcome was almost inevitable. A third party intervener rule could have remediated the damage caused by the conflict. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Velasquez, JD; Lara, MA; Nof, SY				Velasquez, Juan D.; Lara, Marco A.; Nof, Shimon Y.			Systematic resolution of conflict situations in collaborative facility design	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Design conflict; Conflict modeling and analysis; Conflict resolution	E-WORK; PART; MODELS	In this work, a new method to resolve conflict situations (Mcr) common in collaborative facility design using computer support tools is developed. The method uses traditional human conflict resolution approaches that have been used successfully by others. It incorporates principles for prevention of conflict perpetuation and escalation to improve design performance, and applies computer-based learning to improve usefulness. A graph model for conflict resolution is used to facilitate conflict modeling and analysis, one of the incorporated principles for prevention of conflict perpetuation and escalation. The performance of the new method have been validated by implementing its conflict resolution capabilities in the Facility Description Language (FDL), a computer tool for collaborative facility design, and by applying Facility Description Language for Conflict Resolution (FDL-CR), to resolve typical aforementioned conflict situations. The results found in this research are: (1) incorporation of principles for prevention of conflict perpetuation and escalation improved effectiveness; (2) implementation of computer-based learning increased usefulness; and (3) integration of conflict detection and resolution resulted in increased effectiveness of the facility design process.

J	Langenegger, TW; hipel, keith william				Langenegger, Tobias W.; hipel, keith william			The Strategy of Escalation and Negotiation: The Iran Nuclear Dispute	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Negotiation; Graph Model for Conflict Resolution; Iran; US; nuclear security; economic sanctions	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; ATTITUDES	The strategic decisions and resulting consequences surrounding the conflict between the United States of America (US) and Iran regarding the Iranian nuclear program are formally investigated using a flexible decision methodology called the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR). This highly controversial dispute caught the world's attention as concerns were growing that Iran would reach a position where it would be able to build nuclear weapons, thereby posing a risk to world security. While Iran insisted on its rights for the peaceful use of nuclear technology, the international community, led by the US, tried to discourage the nuclear activities of Iran to ensure its obligations to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. This led to an escalation of tension on both sides, with an extension of the nuclear program by Iran and an increase in sanctions by the US, before it was possible to arrive at a negotiated agreement. As demonstrated in this paper, a systematic GMCR investigation provides valuable strategic insights into this important conflict. Further, it illustrates ways in which the conflict could have evolved, as well as mechanisms for stopping an escalation like this in the future.

More specifically, the controversy over the Energy East Pipeline for shipping bitumen from the Alberta oil sands for refining in Central and Eastern Canada as well as shipping overseas is investigated using the usual definitions for stability as well as the metarational tree methodology in which policies can be taken into account. As demonstrated by the case study, enhanced strategic insights can be garnered when the metarational tree approach is utilised for exploring conflict resolution within the confines of existing policy. The metarational tree procedure constitutes a useful expansion of the overall Graph Model for Conflict Resolution set of techniques for formally investigating real world disputes.

J	li, kevin w.; Inohara, T; Xu, HY				Li, Kevin W.; Inohara, Takehiro; Xu, Haiyan			Coalition analysis with preference uncertainty in group decision support	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Conflict analysis; Coalition analysis; Preference uncertainty; Graph model	STATUS-QUO ANALYSIS; GRAPH MODEL; ATTRIBUTE CONFLICT	Coalition analysis is extended to incorporate uncertain preference into three stability concepts, general metarationality (GMR), symmetric metarationality (SMR), and sequential stability (SEQ) under the paradigm of the graph model for conflict resolution. As a follow-up analysis in the graph model, coalition analysis aims to assess whether equilibriums under individual calculations are vulnerable to coalition moves and countermoves and, hence, become unstable under coalition stabilities. Coalition analysis has been considered for transitive graph models with simple preference under four stabilities, Nash, GMR, SMR, and SEQ, as well as general graph models with uncertain preference for the Nash stability. This paper introduces preference uncertainty into coalition stabilities under GMR, SMR, and SEQ for general graph models that can be transitive or intransitive. Depending on the focal coalition's different attitudes towards preference uncertainty, four different extensions are presented. Interrelationships of coalition stabilities are investigated within each extension and across the four extensions. A case study is carried out to illustrate how to apply the proposed coalition stabilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Standard practice is to carry out a stability analysis of a graph model, and then to follow up with a post-stability analysis, an important component of which is status quo analysis. A graph model can be viewed as an edge-colored graph, but the fundamental problem of status quo analysis - to find a shortest colored path from the status quo node to a desired equilibrium - is different from the well-known network analysis problem of finding the shortest path between two nodes. The only matrix method that has been proposed cannot track all aspects of the evolution of a conflict from the status quo state. Our explicit algebraic approach is convenient for computer implementation and, as demonstrated with a real world case study, easy to use. It provides new insights into a graph model, not only identifying all equilibria reachable from the status quo, but also how to reach them. Moreover, this approach bridges the gap between stability analysis and status quo analysis in the graph model for conflict resolution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Kilgour, D.

The conflict arose because the state of Montana feared that further expansion of the Sage Creek Coal Company facilities in Canada would pollute the Flathead River, which flows from British Columbia to Montana. Significant insights not generally available from a static stability analysis are obtained about potential resolutions of the conflict under study and about how decision makers' interactions may direct the conflict to distinct resolutions. Analyses also show how political considerations may affect a particular decision maker's choice, thereby influencing the evolution of the conflict.

More specifically, we consider a GMCR with two DMs, where a DM, in some given state, can be unconscious about some of his options, or about the options of his opponent, and therefore, may have only a partial knowledge of the state space. By interactive unawareness, it is meant that a DM can reason about the awareness level of the other DM and about the awareness level of the other DM regarding his or her own awareness level and so on. We generalize standard solution concepts for this model and illustrate its usefulness by means of a hypothetical war conflict.

The methodology employs value-focused thinking, the analytic hierarchy process, and a variety of methods, such as criteria-satisficing, optimizing, prioritization and weighting, to capture different value judgments. The methodology is operationalized for integration with the graph model for conflict resolution, which facilitates modeling and analysis of strategic conflicts. In applying the proposed methodology, preferences take into account evolving contextual variables in order to simulate participants' responses in a dynamic environment. The effects of different value systems on preferences and resulting conflict dynamics are demonstrated for a theoretical common-pool resources dilemma.

The algorithms are based on the most commonly used stability concepts in the graph model for conflict resolution methodology and function by reducing the set of possible preference rankings for each decision-maker (DM). The reduction is based on observable moves and counter-moves made by DMs. This procedure assists stakeholders in optimizing their own decision-making process based on information gathered about their opponents and can also be used to improve the modeling of strategic interactions. A simple case study is used to illustrate the applicability of the algorithms.

J	Yu, J; Pei, LL				Yu, Jing; Pei, Ling-Ling			Investigation of a Brownfield Conflict Considering the Strength of Preferences	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						brownfield; conflict analysis; strength of preference; option prioritization	GRAPH MODEL; OPTION PRIORITIZATION; DECISION-SUPPORT; RESOLUTION; SYSTEM	By employing the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution methodology, this paper models and analyzes a brownfield conflict that occurred at the Changzhou Foreign Language School in Jiangsu, China, in 2016. This conflict made national headlines when news reports revealed that a large number of students and staff suffered from health issues after the school moved to a new site that is built on recently restored land adjacent to the original "Chang Long Chemical" block. Since stakeholders in the conflict hold different strengths of preference, a new option prioritization technique is employed to elicit both crisp preferences and the strength of preferences for the decision-makers (DMs) in the conflict. The conflict analysis result is consistent with the actual trajectory of the conflict and provides strategic insights into the conflict. More specifically, equilibrium results suggest that the firm should have been required to thoroughly clean the site, the local government should not have relocated the school, and the environmental agency and other stakeholders should have closely monitored the firm's activities. In short, strategic insights garnered from this case study indicate that positive interactions should be fostered among the local government, the enterprise, and the public to ensure sustainable brownfield land redevelopment in the future.

Formal definitions of Nash, general metarational, symmetric metarational, and sequential stability decision rules reflecting human behavior under conflict are presented in this paper. The definitions are inspired by the solution concepts of the graph model for conflict resolution and are conceived for implantation in the proposed agent-based modeling and simulation framework. With these decision rules, competitive and cooperative conflict dynamics are simulated for a theoretical common-pool resources dilemma. Moreover, policies can be tested for their effectiveness in avoiding or recouping from a tragedy of the commons.

Theory and implementation of coalitional analysis in cooperative decision making	THEORY AND DECISION			English	Article						Coalitional stability; Algebraical expression; Decision maker; Graph model; Cooperative decision	GRAPH MODEL; SUPPORT-SYSTEM; MATRIX; PREFERENCE; RESOLUTION; EDGE	Stability definitions for describing human behavior under conflict when coalitions may form are generalized within the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution and algebraic formulations of these definitions are provided to allow computer implementation. The more general definitions of coalitional stabilities relax the assumption of transitive graphs capturing movements under the control of decision makers, either independently or cooperatively, and allow the convenient expansion to the case of coalitions of the four basic individual stabilities consisting of Nash stability, general metarationality, symmetric metarationality, and sequential stability. To permit the various coalitional stabilities to be efficiently calculated and conveniently encoded within a decision support system, algebraic expressions for the coalitional stabilities are provided in this research. Furthermore, a range of the theorems establish the mathematical credibility of employing the innovative algebraic approach to conflict resolution when coalitions are present.

J	Liu, Y				Liu, Yong			Graph Model for Conflict Resolution with Grey Information and Application	JOURNAL OF GREY SYSTEM			English	Article						Grey Information; GMCR; Grey Number; Preference Ranking	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; PREFERENCE	The preferences of (Decision makers)DMs may be uncertain as a result of much more uncertain information existing such as grey information, in real conflict problems, so that it is difficult for the classical graph model for conflict resolution(GMCR) to make quantitatively the preference ranking and deal with. In view of this, the grey number is introduced to express grey information, and then a ranking method is proposed to determine the grey preference rankings of DMs, so that a novel graph model with grey information is established to solve equilibrium states and decision paths. By means of analyzing a conflict example, the results show that the proposed model can deal with conflict problems with uncertain information well, and objectively give the preference rankings of conflict states of decision makers in the form of a quantitative description instead of subjective judgment.

As an extension of the two-level hierarchical graph model, this new structure contains several smaller graph models, called local graphs, nested at three levels. Decision makers (DMs), states, moves, and preference relations in the three-level hierarchical graph model (3LHGM) are defined. The interrelationships between stabilities in local graph models and the overall graph model are investigated and utilized in developing algorithms to calculate stabilities in the hierarchical graph model. This novel methodology is then illustrated using a generic model of hierarchical climate change governance disputes. Stability calculations can uncover profitable courses of action. The 3LHGM aims to provide insightful resolutions for DMs with a broader vision of the hierarchical conflict they are participating in.

A decision makera"parts per thousand s attitudes are expressed in his consideration of his own preferences, as well as those of his opponents. Dominating attitudes are used to suggest that in a circumstance in which a decision maker takes into account multiple perspectives due to his attitudes, he may favor one perspective more heavily. The analysis of a brownfield acquisition conflict illustrates the types of insights that this methodology reveals.

Using an actual case study, a decision support system based on the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR II), is employed to effectively investigate the strategic interactions that took place between an owner and a general contractor concerning the financing of a construction project. The conflict analysis process considers the decision participants, their decision options, and their relative preferences when modeling the dispute. GMCR II is then used to perform an in-depth stability analysis in order to ascertain the possible compromise resolutions or equilibria. In the case study, GMCR II correctly predicts the sequence of decisions that took place in the dispute and furnishes an array of useful strategic insights about the conflict. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is executed to determine how changes in preferences can affect the equilibrium results. This conflict resolution procedure is useful for both researchers and practitioners to better deal with the dispute-prone nature of the construction industry.

J	li, kevin w.; kilgour, d. marc; hipel, keith william				li, kevin w.; kilgour, d. marc; hipel, keith william			Status quo analysis in the graph model for conflict resolution	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						conflict analysis; decision support system; status quo analysis; graph model; algorithm	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM	The graph model for conflict resolution, an analysis paradigm for strategic conflicts, has mainly relied on stability analysis for its conclusions. This paper proposes algorithms to apply another analysis technique, status quo analysis, to a graph model. Status quo analysis is dynamic and forward-looking, in contrast to Stability Analysis, which is static and contingent. Status quo analysis is carried out by means of a directed graph that tracks moves and countermoves from a status quo state, and a table that records the reachability status of states from the status quo. Different algorithms are proposed to produce status quo diagrams with and without restrictions on moves; more efficient versions of the algorithm for the case of transitive graphs are also put forward. Properties of diagrams generated by different algorithms are investigated. A case study illustrates how status quo analysis can be applied, and how it interacts with other analysis methodologies.

Marc			Advanced Decision Support for the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution	JOURNAL OF DECISION SYSTEMS			English	Article						decision support system; conflict resolution; graph model; inverse approach; negotiation	NEGOTIATION; PREFERENCE; UNCERTAINTY; MANAGEMENT; STRENGTH; SYSTEM	An advanced decision support system (DSS) for implementing the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) is designed and illustrated using a real world conflict. The new system, called GMCR+, is capable of handling a wide variety of decision problems involving two or more decision-makers (DMs). Given the DMs, the options or courses of action available to each of them, and each DM's relative preferences over the possible scenarios or states that could occur, GMCR+ can calculate stability and equilibrium results according to a rich range of solution concepts that explain human behaviour under conflict. Then the inverse component of the DSS GMCR+ can determine what DMs' preference rankings of states must be in order to produce stable states and equilibria as specified by the user. Other features incorporated into GMCR+ include coalition analysis, graph and tree diagram visualisation, narrative reporting of results and a tracing feature that shows how the conflict could evolve from a status quo state to a desirable equilibrium or other specified outcome. The system GMCR+ has a modular design in order to facilitate the addition of further advancements.

In each phase, the graph model for conflict resolution is employed for obtaining equilibria and strategic insights while confrontation analysis, a procedure for applying drama theory, is used to expose dilemmas faced by the decision makers. The results of the conflict analyses obtained for the three phases indicate that the two techniques complement one another and thereby provide a broader understanding about what occurred and how the dispute evolved over time. A potential resolution to the conflict occurs at a strategically stable outcome when decision makers do not face any dilemmas and their emotions are dissipated.

Fuzzy preferences in multiple participant decision making	SCIENTIA IRANICA			English	Article						Multiple participants; Conflict; Fuzzy preference; Graph model; Fuzzy relative strength of preference; Fuzzy satisficing threshold; Fuzzy unilateral improvement; Fuzzy stability; Fuzzy equilibrium	GRAPH MODEL; AGGREGATION OPERATORS; CONFLICT-RESOLUTION; WATER-RESOURCES; SYSTEMS; UNCERTAINTY; STRENGTH; SUPPORT	A fuzzy set theoretic approach for handling preference uncertainty within the paradigm of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution is employed for systematically carrying out the strategic investigation of a conflict over the proposed export of water in bulk quantities. Following an overview of the literature regarding fuzzy preferences and their applications in decision making, the graph model is restructured to incorporate fuzzy preferences into calculations of stability. Nash and sequential stability definitions, which reflect human behavior in conflict, are modified to accommodate fuzzy preferences. The conflict over the potential large-scale export of water from Lake Gisborne, located in Canada's Newfoundland and Labrador province, is modeled, assuming that one of the four Decision Makers (DMs) in the dispute has fuzzy or uncertain preferences, while the preferences of the remaining DMs are crisp. The strategic insights gained by varying the satisficing behavior of the DM with fuzzy preferences are discussed. (C) 2011 Sharif University of Technology. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

Marc			Water Diversion Conflicts in China: A Hierarchical Perspective	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						South-North Water Diversion Project; Graph Model for Conflict Resolution; Hierarchical conflict; Water shortages	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; GRAPH MODEL; EFFICIENCY; RESOURCES; PREFERENCE; IMPACT; BASIN	To address China's large population and uneven distribution of water storage, the South-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) aims at transferring water from the Yangtze River (Changjiang) Basin to the North China Plain. This project is being implemented over three different routes, referred to as the Eastern, Central, and Western routes, each of which is giving rise to strategic conflicts. In this paper, the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) is used to systematically investigate these conflicts and obtain strategic insights into them. The Chinese Central Government is involved in each conflict, together with local decision makers, making the entire conflict hierarchical. The conflict is analyzed both as an overall graph model and as three local conflicts, and the resulting equilibria are compared. The Central Government's preferences, which can be fully elaborated in the single or overall model, account for the differences in equilibria between the overall model and the three local models. The Central Government, which utilizes different strategies in planning, modifying, and building these routes, may be able to control the overall project as it wishes, thereby reaching separate agreements with the relevant decision makers along each route.

The system is developed to provide real-time feedback to assist in the structuring and modeling of a conflict situation. A system architecture integrating the decision support system GMCR 11, which implements a methodology called the graph model for conflict resolution, and the GMCRCBR system is developed. The issues of case representation, case storage, case retrieval, and case reuse are considered. Information on 104 conflict cases that have been analyzed using the graph model for conflict resolution is collected and stored. The system is first tested and verified using the case base and then the system's ability to retrieve similar cases is evaluated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Roughly, an equilibrium is robust if it is resilient, or resistant to deviation. Robustness assessment is based on a new concept called Level of Freedom, which evaluates the relative freedom of a decision maker to escape an equilibrium. Resolutions of a conflict can be affected by changes in decision makers' preferences, which may destabilize an equilibrium, causing the conflict to evolve. Hence, a conflict may become long-term and thereby continue to evolve, even after reaching an equilibrium. The new robustness measure is used to rank equilibria based on robustness, to facilitate distinguishing equilibria that are relatively sustainable. An absolutely robust equilibrium is a special case in which the level of freedom is at an absolute minimum for each individual stability definition.

J	Rego, LC; dos Santos, AM				rego, leandro chaves; dos Santos, Andrea Maria			Probabilistic Preferences in the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS			English	Article						Conflict; graph model; preference uncertainty; probabilistic preferences; stability notions	UNCERTAINTY	We present a generalization of the graph model for conflict resolution, introducing the possibility of decision makers (DMs) expressing their preferences among the possible scenarios through probabilistic preferences. In this new scenario, four stability definitions (solution concepts) are proposed: 1) alpha-Nash stability; 2) (alpha, beta)-metarationality; 3) (alpha, beta)-symmetric metarationality; and 4) (alpha, beta, gamma)-sequential stability. We deal with conflicts that involve two or more DMs. Relationships between these definitions are demonstrated, as well as an analysis of how the values of the parameters alpha, beta, and. influence the set of stable states is made. Applications of the proposed model to conflicts involving two and three DMs are presented. The analysis of these applications highlights the advantages gained by allowing individuals to express their preferences probabilistically.

Marc			Multiple levels of preference in interactive strategic decisions	DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Multiple-level hierarchies of preference; Degree of preference; Stability; Graph model for conflict resolution; Multiple decision makers	GRAPH MODEL; CONFLICT-RESOLUTION; SUPPORT-SYSTEM; STRENGTH	A multiple-level preference ranking structure is developed within the paradigm of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution to study multi-objective decision making in conflict situations more realistically. In this structure, a decision maker may have multiple levels of preference for one state or scenario over another: for example, if state A is preferred to state B, it may be mildly preferred at level 1, more strongly preferred at level 2, ..., or maximally preferred at level r, where r > 0 is a fixed parameter. The number of levels, r, is unrestricted in this system, thereby extending earlier two-level (r = 1) and three-level (r = 2) structures. Multilevel versions Of four stability definitions, Nash stability, general metarationality, symmetric metarationality, and sequential stability, are defined for the graph model with this extended preference structure. and the relationships among them are investigated. A specific case study, including multiple decision makers and multiple levels of preference, is carried out to illustrate how the new solution concepts can be applied in practice.

This structure can handle a decision-maker's (DM) strict preference for one state or scenario over another, equal preference for states, and uncertain or unknown preference in the comparison of two states. Built upon this preference structure, four types of solution definitions modeling human behavior under conflict are extended to accommodate uncertainty in preferences. Four distinct ways to consider uncertain preference information are identified, producing sixteen extended stability definitions. Interrelationships of these definitions within and across the four definition sets are investigated. Illustrative examples of two-DM and multi-DM conflict models are presented to show how the new solution concepts can be applied in practice.

The objective is to gain insight into the causes and resolutions of these disputes, and to learn how similar situations can be effectively managed in the future. All three conflicts involve Turkey, the upstream country of both the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, and one or both of Syria and Iraq, which lie downstream. The analysis will demonstrate the importance to conflict resolution of coalitions and of third-Party interventions.

A graph model is both a formal representation for multiple participant-multiple objective decision problems and a set of analysis procedures that add insights into them. Within the new framework, graph models can include-and integrate into the analysis-both certain and uncertain information about DMs' preferences. One key contribution of this study is to extend the four basic stability definitions for two or more DMs to models with fuzzy preferences. Together, fuzzy Nash stability, fuzzy general metarationality, fuzzy symmetric metarationality, and fuzzy sequential stability provide a nuanced description of human behavior. A state is fuzzy stable for a DM if amove to any other state is not sufficiently likely to yield an outcome which the DM prefers, where sufficiency is measured according to a fuzzy satisficing threshold that is the characteristic of the DM. A fuzzy equilibrium, which is an outcome that is fuzzy stable for all DMs, therefore represents a possible resolution of the strategic conflict. The practical application and interpretation of these new stability definitions are illustrated with an example.

To illustrate how these generalized stability definitions can be applied to a real conflict, they are used to analyze an offshore oil exploration dispute that occurred in the South China Sea in 2014. The novel approach reveals which coalitions can upset a noncooperative equilibrium or support new cooperative equilibria, and which decision makers can benefit from joining a coalition.

The novel hybrid preference structure provides DMs with a more flexible technique to express preference. It is capable of covering the unknown preference of one feasible state over another, as well as fuzzy preference. Moreover, within the new hybrid preference structure, four extension forms of unknown preference are defined for different fuzzy stability definitions. These stability definitions under the new hybrid preference can be employed to thoroughly investigate complex conflicts existing in practical applications, and can offer enhanced strategic insights regarding the conflicts. A specific real-world water diversion conflict occurring in China, which includes multiple DMs and hybrid preference, is utilized to investigate how the new hybrid preference framework of the GMCR can be conveniently applied in practice.

The isomorphism between the characteristics that define and drive conflict and those that engender emotions makes it feasible to reconcile emotions with current conflict analysis techniques. Building on Damasio's somatic markers hypothesis, the concept of possibility facilitates modeling the effects of emotion on the scenarios apprehended by the decision makers. Attention is focused on two subsets of the conventional set of feasible states, the hiddenstates that are invisible because of existing emotions (usually negative), and the possiblestates that are invisible because of missing emotions (usually positive). These new concepts can be incorporated within the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution. A model of the confrontation between the United States and North Korea over nuclear weapons demonstrates that the new concepts can simplify analysis and make new predictions that are consistent with the actual unfolding of events. Our main goals are to draw attention to the centrality of emotion in conflict and to the need for research on the incorporation of emotions into conflict analysis and resolution methods.

Conflicts may arise also among public players. For example, a local government may insist on the interest of the region while the national government represents the interests of the whole country. Conflict analysis is one of the methods to model such conflicts mathematically. Its stability analysis specifies stable states based on the ordinal information on players' preferences. However, if the preference of a player is private, stability of states is not known. In such a case, players or third parties have to collect additional information on other players' preference. It is necessary to specify the minimum information to collect. In this paper, graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR) is extended for the cases with incomplete information. Then, the generalized robustness analysis is proposed to specify the minimum conditions for stability of states. Finally, robustness analysis is applied to the conflict on water resources development.

Marc; Zhao, Min			Option prioritization for unknown preference	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Graph model for conflict resolution; option prioritization; unknown preference; logical connectives	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; GRAPH MODEL; ATTITUDES	An option prioritization technique is developed to efficiently elicit the preferences, both unknown and crisp, of decision makers (DMs) in strategic conflicts. In the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution, each DM has one or more options, each of which may be selected or not. A state, or possible scenario, is formed when all DMs make an option selection. The software GMCR II contains an option prioritization procedure that makes it easy for a modeller to enter a DM's crisp preference ordering over the states using prioritized statements describing the DM's preferred option combinations. This procedure is extended by adding two new logical connectives that describe uncertainty of preference. For each DM, a range of possible scores for each feasible state can then be calculated, facilitating the determination of a preference ordering containing uncertainty by comparing and ranking scores. To demonstrate how this new methodology can be used to represent unknown preferences in a real-world decision problem, it is applied to a Canadian dispute over proposed water exports.

An inverse GMCR is introduced to utilize the GMCR as a negotiation tool by altering the procedure of the original framework. The methodologies presented give a better understanding of how decision makers (DMs) can be motivated to undertake certain actions within the conflict. Moreover, the inverse GMCR tackles the problem of specifying which preferences for DMs lead to a particular resolution, thereby making it easier for a mediator or other third party to influence the course of the conflict. The methodologies are applied to a real-world dispute, a complex water conflict in the Middle East.

In this triplet preference structure, a decision-maker may greatly prefer or prefer one state or scenario to another, or may be indifferent between them. Four stability definitions ( solution concepts), Nash stability ( R), general metarationality ( GMR), symmetric metarationality ( SMR), and sequential stability ( SEQ), are extended to include strong and weak stabilities for the case of conflicts with two decision makers. Theorems that clarify the interrelationships of the strong and weak versions of these solution concepts are presented. The application of this new preference structure and the associated solution concepts is demonstrated in an environmental conflict model, called the Sustainable Development Conflict. This case shows that valuable strategic insights are gained when strength of preference is integrated into the stability analysis.

Specifically, based on the concept of joint movement by members of a coalition, the noncooperative stability definitions of Nash, general metarational, symmetric metarational, and sequential stability are extended for employment in coalition analysis. To demonstrate how the coalition stability definitions can be conveniently applied to an actual conflict, they are used to investigate a dispute arising over the pollution of an aquifer by a chemical plant located in Elmira, Ontario, Canada, and thereby obtain valuable strategic insight regarding cooperative behavior.

This encompassing GMCR methodology has been constructed during the past three decades by the authors, their colleagues and students from many countries for addressing a rich range of conflict situations. GMCR can be used for studying large and small conflicts and includes methods for preference elicitation, preference uncertainty (unknown, fuzzy, grey numbers and probabilistic). Many kinds of definitions exist for possible human behavior under pure competition which can be transformed for utilization in coalition analysis. GMCR can handle emotions, attitudes, and misperceptions. Within inverse GMCR, one can calculate the preferences needed by decision makers (DMs) to reach a desirable equilibrium. Under behavioral GMCR one can ascertain the strategic thinking of DMs when the input and output are known. Decision support systems can be built for implementing the array of GMCR advancements. Future expansions of GMCR can be guided by key characteristics of actual disputes. Artificial intelligence (AI) GMCR is a promising subfield of study within GMCR.

J	Garcia, A; Hipel, K; obeidi, amer				Garcia, Amanda; hipel, keith william; Obeidi, Amer			Water pricing conflict in British Columbia	HYDROLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Graph Model for Conflict Resolution; policy; water pricing; generalized metarationalities	GRAPH MODEL; GENERALIZED METARATIONALITIES; RESOLUTION	The Water Sustainability Act in British Columbia, Canada is a source of conflict among citizens, the provincial government, and industrial groundwater users. The water extraction fees stipulated in the act highlight the issue of water commodification and its potential legal consequences. Complementary approaches for conflict analysis are used to study this emerging conflict in order to gain valuable strategic insights. Analysis is performed using the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution, a flexible methodology for analyzing and modelling conflicts. In addition, generalized metarationalities and metarational trees, which account for the role and influence of policies in decisionmaking, are used to explore possible resolutions of the conflict. The analyses show that the current situation, where protesters lobby the government but the fees are not increased, is an equilibrium and thus unlikely to change.

J	Garcia, A; hipel, keith william				garcia, amanda; hipel, keith william			Inverse engineering preferences in simple games	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Conflict resolution; Preferences; Game theory; Graph Model for Conflict Resolution	GRAPH MODEL; CONFLICT-RESOLUTION; UNCERTAINTY; STRENGTH	A method for inverse engineering decision-makers' preferences based on observable behaviour is designed. This technique allows analysts to narrow down the list of potential preference rankings of possible states in a conflict for each decision-maker using probabilities and expected values. During the inverse engineering procedure, the list of all possible preference rankings is narrowed as decision-makers move and counter-move. Accurate preference information is key to building quality conflict and game models; however, preference rankings for decision-makers are often difficult to obtain directly. A simple two decision-maker, four-state game is used to demonstrate the applicability of the method and to illustrate the insights it provides. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Marc			Behavioral Analysis in the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS			English	Article						Behavioral analysis; conflict resolution; graph model; matrix representations	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; MATRIX REPRESENTATION; EQUILIBRIA; ROBUSTNESS; PREFERENCE	Using the observed or desired stability results of each decision maker (DM) and the equilibrium of a conflict, an algorithm is proposed that determines whether the Nash, general metarationality, symmetric metarationality or sequential stability definition best explains the observations or how to achieve the desired equilibrium. The matrix representation of the graph model for conflict resolution, normally used to determine stabilities that reflect different models of human interaction in conflict, is utilized here to keep track of available one-step moves for each DM, as well as the DMs' relative preferences among states. A key theorem involving matrix representation of graph models determines which stability types are consistent with the observations or achievement of the desired equilibrium, taking into account specified preferences of the DMs, for the case of two or more DMs. To illustrate the use of the algorithm in practice, behavioral analysis is applied to a softwood lumber dispute between Canada and the USA.

This investigation of the situation as it existed in late 2016 constitutes an expansion of an earlier analysis of the dispute which focused on cleansing the groundwater aquifer, polluted by a chemical company in Elmira, to a controversy over the management of the pollution impacts on an adjacent creek. Besides the chemical plant, the other decision-makers involved in the 2016 dispute are the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change of the Province of Ontario, local government, and a citizens' advisory group. The connections of the 2016 conflict to the earlier study which took place in 1991 are discussed and the evolution of the previous situation to the current one is explored in depth, along with strategic insights.

It seeks feasible compromise term among decision makers by using optimal results for different proposals of solutions. The process is developed by applying the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution. The case study is the existing conflict among Coqueiros canal water users. This 45 km canal belongs to a complex irrigation and drainage canal network and it is located at Campos dos Goytacazes municipality, in the northern region of the State of Rio de Janeiro. Its basin has a potential irrigable area of approximately 14,000 ha. Six hypothetical scenarios have been built, each one corresponding to different alternatives to the conflict solution. In addition, two different tendencies were adopted by the Management Institution (MI) in order to take care of the conflict. The first tendency takes into account that the MI has no explicit preferences for any of its actions. As for the second one, the MI shows explicit preferences for the scenarios which provide more income taxes. Some scenarios that reached the state of equilibrium were analyzed to provide solutions to the conflict.

The overriding objective of perceptual stability analysis is to predict possible resolutions, and unveil the dependence of these predictions on variability in a DM's awareness. Perceptual stability analysis takes a two-phase approach. In Phase 1, individual stability analysis is applied to each DM's graph model ( a perceptual graph model) from the point of view of the owner of the model, for each DM in the model, using standard or perceptual solution concepts, depending on the owner's awareness of others' perceptions. Then, in Phase 2, metastability analysis is employed to consolidate the stability assessments of a state in all perceptual graph models and across all variants of awareness-i.e., in all possible graph model systems. The distinctive modes of equilibria thus defined reflect the incompatibilities in DMs' perceptions and viewpoints, but nonetheless provide important insights into possible resolutions of the conflict. To demonstrate the practical application of these new developments, a model of the conflict in Chechnya is presented and analyzed.

J	Getirana, ACV; Malta, VD				vieira getirana, augusto cesar; Malta, Valeria de Fatima			Investigating Strategies of an Irrigation Conflict	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Water resources management; Conflict analysis; GMCR	GRAPH MODEL; EQUILIBRIA; WATERS; SYSTEM; BASIN; GAME	The understanding and modeling of human behavior in conflict situations is a challenge that researches investigate by developing, modifying and applying computational models. This paper aims to analyze how changes in the strategies of the various groups involved in a water use conflict can influence the decision process. The case study is an irrigation system supplied by a main canal in Rio de Janeiro State, Southeastern Brazil. Conflicts arise due to hydraulic constraints of the canal, resulting in water unavailability for some irrigators or damage to potentially irrigable lands caused by adjacent floods. The investigation strategy has been developed, considering three groups of irrigators. They can be geographically identified over the main canal's hydrographical limits. Six different scenarios are considered to analyze the conflict. These scenarios are built taking into account six different policies of water conveyance. Additionally, the decision of the state government related to water charging has been considered. The final decision is taken by the management institution of the canal which also has two different tendencies: to opt for the scenarios providing highest net profits or to be impartial in the final decision. The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution, which solves non-cooperative games based on graph theory, was adopted to evaluate all these strategies. The results show that, according to the level of exigency of irrigator groups, state government and management institution, the conflict can in fact, be resolved.

J	Sabtan, B; Kilgour, MD; hipel, keith william				Sabtan, Bader; kilgour, d. marc; hipel, keith william			Assessing the effectiveness of economic sanctions	EURO JOURNAL ON DECISION PROCESSES			English	Article						Conflict resolution; Graph model; Inverse preference problem; Economic sanctions; Stability analysis		The strength of sanctions can significantly impact the outcome of a dispute. The effectiveness of economic sanctions will be explored within the context of the conflict between Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and US shale oil producers in 2014. The outcome was not what OPEC anticipated, perhaps because OPEC misperceived the opponent's preferences. Sensitivity to sanctions is a major component of a decision maker's preferences when a dispute, or a negotiation, is modeled within the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR). This study uses Inverse GMCR to determine what preference rankings would be required for the conflict to end as OPEC wished. The difference between the original preference ranking and the required rankings reflects the miscalculation of the strength of the economic "squeeze" that OPEC imposed when it flooded the market with oil to reduce the price. OPEC expected this sanction to be strong enough to damage, and perhaps destroy, the shale industry, but shale producers were able to withstand it. The graph model analysis suggests why this conflict ended as it did, and provides guidelines for understanding whether sanctions can be effective in forcing a particular outcome on a dispute.

A DM's attitudes are expressed in her or his consideration of her own preferences, as well as those of her opponents. Understanding these attitudes is essential to having a grasp on the possible outcomes of a given conflict. However, these attitudes are often difficult to represent and even more difficult to encode effectively within a decision support system. Therefore, a matrix representation, which constitutes a more efficient way of expressing attitudes in a programming environment, is developed in this research.

In particular, the possibility principle facilitates modeling the effects of emotions on future scenarios contemplated by decision makers, while perceptual graph models and the associated graph model system permit the decision makers to experience and view the conflict independently. These new theoretical advances expand current modeling capabilities, thereby furnishing realistic, descriptive models without exacting too great a cost in modeling complexity. Specifically, these developments enhance the applicability of the modeling algorithms within the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution to real-world disputes by integrating emotion and perception, common ingredients in almost all conflicts. To demonstrate that the new developments are practical, an illustrative application to a real-world conflict is presented.

Fuzzy preferences in conflicts	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						environmental conflict; fuzzy sets; Graph Model for Conflict Resolution; preferences; multiple participants	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; GRAPH MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; STRENGTH; WEIGHTS; GAME	A systematic fuzzy approach is developed to model fuzziness and uncertainties in the preferences of decision makers involved in a conflict. This unique fuzzy preference formulation is used within the paradigm of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution in which a given dispute is modeled in terms of decision makers, each decision maker's courses of actions or options, and each decision maker's preferences concerning the states or outcomes which could take place. In order to be able to determine the stability of each state for each decision maker and the possible equilibria or resolutions, a range of solution concepts describing potential human behavior under. conflict are defined for use with fuzzy preferences. More specifically, strong and weak definitions of stability are provided for the solution concepts called Nash, general metarational, symmetric metarational, and sequential stability. To illustrate how these solution concepts can be conveniently used in practice, they are applied to a dispute over the contamination of an aquifer by a chemical company located in Elmira, Ontario, Canada.

In particular, the history of game theoretic models for conflict as well as their use in mitigating or resolving environmental conflicts is studied. The models and problem types are categorized to allow for a better understanding of the contrasting areas of environmental conflict management.
